1012,The American President,"""popular democratic president andrew shepherd is preparing to run for re-election. the president and his staff, led by chief of staff and best friend a.j. macinerney, attempt to consolidate the administration's 63% approval rating by passing a moderate crime control bill. however, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: conservatives do not want it, and liberals think it is too weak. if it passes, however, shepherd's re-election is presumed by his staff to be a shoo-in, and shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and the congressional support to pass it, by the state of the union."" with the president of france about to arrive in the united states to attend a state dinner in his honor, shepherd—widowed when his wife died of cancer three years earlier—is placed in an awkward predicament when his cousin judith, with whom he had planned to attend the dinner, gets sick. the president's attention soon focuses on sydney ellen wade, just hired by an environmental lobbying firm to persuade the president to pass legislation committing his administration to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions. during their first meeting, shepherd and wade are immediately intrigued by each other. at this meeting, shepherd strikes a deal with wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill by the date of the state of the union, he will deliver the last 10 votes. whatever his personal feelings toward wade, he expresses this to his staff, especially the pragmatic a.j., as a sound political move. he believes wade will not be able to get enough votes to meet her side of the deal, thus releasing shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass. ""later that evening, in a series of phone calls, shepherd invites wade to the state dinner. during the state dinner and subsequent occasions, the couple fall in love. when the republican presidential hopeful senator bob rumson learns """"""""the president's got a girlfriend,"""""""" he steps up his attacks on shepherd and wade, focusing on wade's activist past and maligning shepherd's ethics and his family values. the president refuses to respond to these attacks, which drives his approval ratings lower and costs him crucial political support, without which his crime bill seems doomed to failure."" at the white house christmas party, wade is dejected about her meeting that day with three congressmen from michigan about the environmental bill and how it was a dismal failure; in the process, she inadvertently mentions to the president and a.j. that the congressmen in question said the only bill they were more interested in defeating than the president's crime bill was wade's environmental bill. shepherd and a.j. are conflicted by this information as wade clearly had no idea of the implications of this casual conversation, much less that they might actually use this information in their favor and against her environmental bill. ""eventually, wade does manage to get enough votes to meet her part of the deal. however, in the meantime, shepherd's team discovers he is exactly three votes short, with no other apparent options to acquire them except by shelving the environmental bill, thus solidifying the support of the three congressmen from michigan—which he agrees to do. this results in disaster for wade as she is immediately fired from her lobbyist job for failing to achieve her objectives, as well as seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation. she visits the white house to break up with shepherd and says that she has a job possibility in hartford, connecticut. he tells her politics is making choices, his number-one has always been the crime control bill, and that he does not want to lose her over this. she congratulates him on getting the leverage to pass a crime bill that in no way will help fight crime. she concludes, """"""""mr. president, you have bigger problems than losing me—you've just lost my vote."""""""""" on the morning that he is to deliver his state of the union address, and after an argument with a.j., shepherd makes a surprise appearance in the white house press room and rebuts rumson's attacks on wade's past and his own values and character. he declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to congress with a massive 20% cut in fossil fuels — far more than the 10% originally envisioned — and that he is withdrawing his support for the weak crime bill, promising to write a stronger one in due time. in his speech he even promises gun control, in an attempt at root-and-branch solving of america's problems. his passionate and erudite defense of those things in which he believes, in contrast to his earlier passive behavior, galvanizes the press and his staff. ""shepherd declares he is """"""""going over to her house and i'm not leaving until i get her back"""""""", but wade enters the oval office before he can leave. the couple are reconciled and the president, accompanied by wade, leaves to give his state of the union address. the film ends with shepherd entering the house chamber to thunderous applause.""",dramatic

socially backwards, stuttering, but good natured young man sits at her feet.outside a bus drops off neil (rick dean), a man with sunglasses and a white cane. he taps his way across the street and into zipper's bar where he orders a drink. the burley bar tender (r.a. mihailoff) tells him he's already served last call, but patron, frankie (george russo) talks the barman into letting him buy the blind man a drink. they both regret this as neil turns out to be an obnoxious loudmouth.outside two corrupt plainclothes cops, roland (george tovar) and joey (patric zimmerman) are cruising the streets. roland is interested in two things: first, getting information on a recent robbery and second, finding a stash of cocaine he can seize to feed his habit. they plan to visit zipper's later as they know the barman is a dealer, but first they drop by informant acid arnie's (m.c. mccurdy) apartment. after grabbing arnie's meager supply of cocaine and pot they threaten him until he snitches on the robbers.back at zipper's, the barman is so annoyed at neil he declares the bar closed and tells everybody to leave. at this point neil pulls off the glasses and reveals he is not blind. he also produces a pistol and orders the barman to lock the front door so nobody can go in or out. he then forces the patrons and staff to sit at the bar while he takes the stage. the group consists of the barman, frankie, frankie's friend buzz (j.r. kuykendall), christina, carey and strippers sandra (nikki fritz) and kitten (ann-marie holman). the butch sandra and the pretty, passive kitten are lesbian lovers.neil is no normal robber and he pistol whips buzz into unconsciousness for asking why he doesn't just take the money and leave. he then turns his attention to a terrified carey, telling him that he will shoot him if he cannot answer a trivia question by the count of five. kristen is able to answer before the deadline and this gives neil another idea. seeing carey's devotion to christina, he orders them to go behind the stage curtain. christina will have six minutes to arouse carey and be engaged in intercourse with him, or he will shoot her.at this outrage the barman confronts neil and neil shoots him in the gut.behind the curtain, at first carey is too scared to get aroused, but christina is able to calm him down and promises him she will take him to vegas if they both live through this. as a bit of comic relief carey murmurs that he doesn't know if he is ready for such a commitment.neil allows sandra to check on the dying barman and give him some water. as she leans close the barman whispers that there is a shotgun behind the bar. from that point on sandra tries to find an excuse to go behind the bar and get the gun, but neil seems too suspicious of her to let her go.after six minutes neil checks behind the curtain and is surprised to find christina and carey making love. leaving them to continue, he now turns his attention on kitten, ordering her to give him a lap dance up on stage. kitten tells him she is too scared, but he threatens to kill her if she does not comply. her eyes are wide with terror she gives him a dance with her fear somehow increasing its eroticism. not satisfied with letting her strip off just her top, he makes her continue until she is only wearing stocking and high heels and only then allows her to return to sandra's sheltering arms.meanwhile the cops, done with arnie, pull up in front of zipper's. they can see that something is wrong as it is well past closing time and the lights are on and there are cars in the parking lot. the cops know something bad is going down and decide to pull behind the bar into an alley so they can smoke some pot and decide if they want to get involved.neil orders carey and christina out from behind the curtain so he can tell the group a story. before going out front christina whispers to carey that she has a gun in her purse and if she can get to it, carey should be ready to distract neil so she can shoot him.neil tells the story of a man with bad chemicals in his brain that makes him do bad things. it is soon clear that he is talking about himself. the man, he says, is considering suicide when he sees a beautiful woman. we soon realize he is talking about christina. the man decides instead of suicide he will stalk the girl getting pleasure out of watching her without her realizing it. he asks christina if she wonders why the guy she went out on a date with never called her back. the answer is given to us in a flashback when we see neil torture and murder him.in the alley the cops have finally decided to intervene by slipping in the back door. joey picks the lock while roland stands behind him with a shotgun.christina, clearly nervous at the thought of neil stalking her, begs him to let her get her cigarettes from her purse. he does and as she fumbles for a lighter, carey starts demanding to go to the restroom. this distracts neil and christina pulls out a pistol and fires at him. her shot is low, though, and hits the chair neil is sitting on and he is uninjured. he returns fire and christina, hit, drops the gun and stumbles back into a corner. kitten tries to crawl over the bar to safety, but is shot by neil. frankie runs toward the back door and is also shot. one of the bullets goes stray, through the back door, and hits cop

285,The Emerald Forest,"""bill markham is an engineer who has moved to brazil with his family to complete the construction of a large hydro-electric dam. the construction requires large areas of forest to be cleared, even more to be flooded. its completion will bring more people to the areas who will clear the jungle for agriculture and living space.when the film opens, markham has taken his family to the edge of the forest for a picnic to show them the jungle and the progress of the dam's construction. the site is abuzz with workers and machines cutting and clearing, but is situated right on the edge of a vast expanse of dense and unexplored amazon terrain. his young son, tommy, aged seven, wanders from the cleared area to just inside the treeline where he amuses himself by feeding his picnic snacks to the large jungle ants. it is then that an indian from one of the indigenous tribes known as the invisible people notices him, and is struck by the boy's blonde hair and bright green eyes, which are the colour of the forest. tommy sees the tribesman, who smiles warmly at him and speaks softly in his language. young tommy then runs out of the treeline to inform markham that the jungle is full of """"""""smiling people"""""""" but his father laughs him off skeptically, telling him he'll be right there to check it out. when tommy returns to the treeline just ahead of markham, the tribesman decides that it is unfair to leave the child with these strange people, who, in his opinion, are destroying the world. he abducts the child. as markham realises his son has just been taken, a warning shot from an unseen archer lands in a tree near his head. regardless of the arrow, markham pursues them, calling upon all the nearby construction workers to help. frantically hacking his way through the undergrowth, markham comes to a ridge in a clearing that reveals before him an endless valley of dense jungle. his son is gone.the story jumps ahead some ten years. the dam is nearing completion. tommy, or tommé as he is now called, has become part of the tribe that he lives with, adopting their language, culture and way of life. the tribesman who took him is revealed to be the chief of the invisible people, and has taken tommé for his own son. tommé is depicted going through rituals of manhood and courtship, becoming involved with a beautiful member of the tribe named kachiri. after their marriage ceremony, he undergoes a vision quest, where his spirit animal shows him what he must do to help his tribe: retrieve the sacred stones from a remote spot deep in the jungle, at the foot of a waterfall. the sacred stones are essentially a mossy-green clay, out of which the invisible people make their signature body paint that allows them to blend in so seamlessly with the jungle. the chief of the tribe informs tommé that the quest will be dangerous, as the fierce people have moved into the area. the fierce people are a hostile tribe of cannibal warriors, who ironically had been displaced from their own lands years earlier by the beginning of the dam's construction. they are now coming into uncomfortably close proximity to the invisible people.meanwhile, in the years after their son's abduction the markham family has not given up hope of finding tommy. bill's wife jean is now a social worker, heavily involved with orphans and displaced children. bill himself has become well versed in tribal amazonian culture in his search for the elusive people who took his son, to the extent that he has become nearly fluent in a few local indian dialects. one day bill hosts a particularly obnoxious journalist who is doing an exploitative piece of the subject of markham's search among indian peoples, and the two of them set off for a mission on the river. the only clue markham has to seek out answers is the arrow that was originally shot at him when his son was abducted. because of the particular fletching used in the arrow, local indians on the river are able to identify the tribe that markham has been seeking, and inform him that he quite unsurprisingly hasn't found them up until this point because they are known as the invisible people. however, markham and his journalist companion, whose cynicism and sarcasm concerning indigenous peoples is beginning to wear on him, set off for a likely place along the river where they intend to camp and set off fireworks and bottle rockets to attract the attention of any uncontacted but curious tribes in the region. unfortunately, the tribe they do stumble upon happens to be the fierce people, who quickly take them into captivity. markham, who is armed with a car-15 carbine, is able to defend himself adequately and just long enough to have an exchange with the leader of the fierce people. the chief informs markham that he admires his tenacity, comparing him to a jaguar, and that after a night's head-start into the jungle he will be hunted at daybreak. the journalist is not so lucky, and is gutted on the spot by the tribe's women. markham then flees the jeering fierce people into the jungle, firing bursts from his carbine into the darkness behind him.shortly after dawn, markham, in hot pursuit and low on ammunition, stumbles into the foot of a waterfall and sees a young indian underneath the falls gathering stones. right before he shoots, the young indian steps forward toward markham and is revealed to be tommé, and the two instantly recognise each other. the moment is shattered when the fierce people burst from the jungle above and behind them in full force, during which markham takes an arrow in the shoulder. tommé and his father fight off the fierce warriors and manage to escape downriver, but markham loses his carbine in the process.back home with the invisible people, markham spends time recovering from his injuries and fighting off a fever. he comes to understand his son's transformation and the tribe's way of life, forging a begrudging respect for the chief who took him as a child. markham himself undergoes a vision quest, discovers his spirit animal, and wakes up back in civilisation having been dropped off by the invisible people at the edge of the dam's construction zone while he was unconscious.during these events, it is revealed that the chief of the fierce people has been busy trying to figure out how to work the carbine markham left behind, which he immediately understands is a formidable weapon. the chief is seen working himself up into a rage whilst stuffing bones and rocks into the firing chamber of the carbine in an increasingly desperate and futile attempt to make it shoot. later, at a seedy brothel and cantina on the edge of the construction zone, the fierce people wander from the jungle with the m4 in hand to essentially ask someone from civilisation how to work the thing. seeing an opportunity, the unscrupulous owners of the brothel manage to communicate to the fierce people that if they are brought some women (motioning to the adjacent jungle) that they would then give the fierce warriors all the guns and bullets they wanted.when coming back to their village from taking markham back home, tommé and his friends in the tribe discover to their horror that the village has been violently raided, many have been killed and all their young women are missing. it is then discovered that the fierce people have sold them all to the brothel for rifles and liquor. tommé and his best friend from the tribe then embark upon a harrowing quest into the city, where he will find his old home according to his childhood memory, and ask his father for help. during the journey, the two tribesmen meet and are helped along by two other young men who are revealed to have been former members of the bat people tribe, but who now live in the city. tommé manages to navigate from memory to his parents' multistory condo, which he climbs like a tree. tommé is seen by his mother during this encounter for the first time in a decade. markham agrees to help tommé and his tribe by rescuing all the women from the brothel.coordinating his attack with the invisible people to take place at night, while all the members of the fierce people are wildly drunk outside the building, markham initiates a shootout in the brothel whilst all the women are sprung from captivity. however, during the attack, several members of the invisible people are killed, including the chief, tommé's adopted tribal father. in the aftermath of this event, tommé becomes chief of the tribe. markham warns tommé that the dam, imminently nearing completion, will bring more people, reduce more jungle, and likely end their way of life, but tommé is obstinate, insisting that the rains will wash the dam away when the frogs sing loudly enough.soon afterward, during a particularly bad storm, markham places demolition explosives at key points along the dam, blowing it up during the peak of the rains. with the dam washed away, tommé and the tribe can live in relative peace for a little while longer.the film ends with tommé and kachiri sitting at the swimming hole near their village in the jungle, watching the members of their tribe splash and play. the tribe even includes a few new members in the two young men from the bat people who had helped tommé earlier. tommé and kachiri laugh together and leisurely speculate on which members of the tribe would make good couples.""",paranormal

inside toms house, john sees rogues gun shells. john realizes that rogues still alive. john believes that rogue killed tom & his family. john wants to get revenge by killing rogue.crawford wants justice for his partner and vows to kill rogue to get even. in the mean time, rogue skillfully incites a war between the triads and yakuzas in san francisco for no apparent reason. rogue seems to be working for the local mafia chang (john lone) while he kills his son-like man in triads and skillfully manages to let him believe it's done by the yakuzas and tips the man's brother about a man working under shiro (ryo ishibashi), leading him to his location of a tea house where the rival gangs fight while rogue sits in a winow picking off anyone coming out with a sniper rifle from both gangs.rogue is a very good fighter, an excellent liar and is skilled at vanishing abruptly. he works for the japanese yakuza while still workin with chang's triad and kills chang upon the japanese mob's orders. but he didn't followed the mob's full order by not killing chang's wife and daughter as he previously promised shiro.crawford finds out rogue had actually changed his face by plastic surgery and found the surgeon who done the same and confirms his current identity of victor shaw (jet li). by his watchmen, crawford manages to get snaps of rogue killing shiro's assassins and assisting the wife and daughter of chang into a car. crawford gives these snaps to the shiro who finally turns up in san francisco cleverly lured by rogue using a pair of priceless gold horse statues (one of them is a fake of the other) from japan. shiro orders his men to torture rogue to find out where chang's wife and daughter were hidden but rogue escapes and kills the shiro's men and sets off the bomb he had in the other suitcase killing almost everyone except shiro. it's revealed that rogue wants to kill shiro too. rogue decides to use a sword to fight shiro. shiro also grabs a sword.shiro asks him why he's doing this and rogue replies that it's because of a killing the shiro had ordered. shiro wondered which one of the many orders and it turns out to be the killing of tom lone and his family. telling he shouldn't have ordered to kill the women and child. shiro realizes that rogue's none other tom lone. rogue killed tom's family, but tom managed to kill rogue. since tom killed rogue, tom used plastic surgery to disguise himself as rogue. 3 years after rogue & tom's family got killed, tom decided to come back to san francisco to destroy shiro's enemies, shiro's henchmen, and shiro. tom wanted to kill shiro last because tom wanted to avenge his family's death. tom/rogue sets on a skilled fight which at last the mob was not able to hold and reveals another stunning truth that it's all because crawford let it happen. this makes another interesting twist and after learning the fact, tom/rogue kills shiro by beheading him.the wife of chang receives a package with a letter saying """"""""make a new life"""""""" from tom/rogue with the original gold horse statue in it. shiro's daughter, who had returned to japan, receives the same letter (in japanese) with a suitcase, which revealed to contain shiro's head.rogue calls crawford to set a meeting at the first known place for both of them and crawford sets a sniper and visits that place to kill rogue. rogue and crawford fight furiously and at one end when they're close to face to face, rogue reveals he's actually tom lone. crawford recognizes tom's eyes and apologizes for what happened, and asks if he could ever forgive him. tom changes his name to rogue. the fbi agent assigned to shoot rogue/lone attempted to target him, but crawford jumps in the way, and tom/rogue shoots him in the back, killing him. even though crawford apologized to tom/rogue, tom/rogue didn't accept crawford's apology. tom/rogue's stupid because he should've accepted crawford's apology.tom/rogue drives away in his car with the suitcase full of money that the triad had given him earlier in the movie, and the movie ends.""",dramatic

""the name lowood symbolizes the """"""""low"""""""" point in jane's life where she was maltreated. helen burns is a representation of charlotte's elder sister maria, who died of tuberculosis after spending time at a school where the children were mistreated."" thornfield hall after six years as a student and two as a teacher at lowood, jane decides to leave, like her friend and confidante miss temple, who recently married. she advertises her services as a governess and receives one reply, from alice fairfax, housekeeper at thornfield hall. jane takes the position, teaching adèle varens, a young french girl. one night, while jane is walking to a nearby town, a horseman passes her. the horse slips on ice and throws the rider. despite the rider's surliness, jane helps him to get back onto his horse. later, back at thornfield, she learns that this man is edward rochester, master of the house. adèle is his ward, left in his care when her mother abandoned her. at jane's first meeting with him within thornfield, mr. rochester teases her, accusing her of bewitching his horse to make him fall. he also talks strangely in other ways, but jane is able to give as good as she gets. mr. rochester and jane soon come to enjoy each other's company, and spend many evenings together. odd things start to happen at the house, such as a strange laugh, a mysterious fire in mr. rochester's room (from which jane saves rochester by rousing him and throwing water on him and the fire), and an attack on a house guest named mr. mason. then jane receives word that her aunt mrs. reed is calling for her, because she suffered a stroke after her son john died. jane returns to gateshead and remains there for a month, attending to her dying aunt. mrs. reed confesses to jane that she wronged her, giving jane a letter from jane's paternal uncle, mr. john eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir. mrs. reed admits to telling mr. eyre that jane had died of fever at lowood. soon afterward, mrs. reed dies, and jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to thornfield. back at thornfield, jane broods over mr. rochester's rumoured impending marriage to the beautiful and talented, but snobbish and heartless, blanche ingram. however, one midsummer evening, rochester baits jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married, but how she will soon forget him. the normally self-controlled jane reveals her feelings for him. rochester is then sure that jane is sincerely in love with him, and he proposes marriage. jane is at first sceptical of his sincerity, but eventually believes him and gladly agrees to marry him. she then writes to her uncle john, telling him of her happy news. as she prepares for her wedding, jane's forebodings arise when a strange woman sneaks into her room one night and rips her wedding veil in two. as with the previous mysterious events, mr. rochester attributes the incident to grace poole, one of his servants. during the wedding ceremony, mr. mason and a lawyer declare that mr. rochester cannot marry because he is already married to mr. mason's sister, bertha. mr. rochester admits this is true but explains that his father tricked him into the marriage for her money. once they were united, he discovered that she was rapidly descending into madness, and so he eventually locked her away in thornfield, hiring grace poole as a nurse to look after her. when grace gets drunk, rochester's wife escapes and causes the strange happenings at thornfield. it turns out that jane's uncle, mr. john eyre, is a friend of mr. mason's and was visited by him soon after mr. eyre received jane's letter about her impending marriage. after the marriage ceremony is broken off, mr. rochester asks jane to go with him to the south of france, and live with him as husband and wife, even though they cannot be married. refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for him, jane leaves thornfield in the middle of the night. other employment jane travels as far from thornfield as she can using the little money she had previously saved. she accidentally leaves her bundle of possessions on the coach and has to sleep on the moor, and unsuccessfully attempts to trade her handkerchief and gloves for food. exhausted and hungry, she eventually makes her way to the home of diana and mary rivers, but is turned away by the housekeeper. she collapses on the doorstep, preparing for her death. st. john rivers -- diana and mary's brother -- and a clergyman save her. after she regains her health, st. john finds jane a teaching position at a nearby village school. jane becomes good friends with the sisters, but st. john remains aloof. the sisters leave for governess jobs, and st. john becomes somewhat closer to jane. st. john learns jane's true identity and astounds her by telling her that her uncle, john eyre, has died and left her his entire fortune of 20,000 pounds (equivalent to over £1.3 million in 2011). when jane questions him further, st. john reveals that john eyre is also his and his sisters' uncle. they had once hoped for a share of the inheritance but were left virtually nothing. jane, overjoyed by finding that she has living and friendly family members, insists on sharing the money equally with her cousins, and diana and mary come back to live at moor house. proposals ""thinking jane will make a suitable missionary's wife, st. john asks her to marry him and to go with him to india, not out of love, but out of duty. jane initially accepts going to india but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting they travel as brother and sister. as soon as jane's resolve against marriage to st. john begins to weaken, she mysteriously hears mr. rochester's voice calling her name. jane then returns to thornfield to find only blackened ruins. she learns that mr. rochester's wife set the house on fire and committed suicide by jumping from the roof. in his rescue attempts, mr. rochester lost a hand and his eyesight. jane reunites with him, but he fears that she will be repulsed by his condition. """"""""am i hideous, jane?"""""""", he asks. """"""""very, sir: you always were, you know"""""""", she replies. when jane assures him of her love and tells him that she will never leave him, mr. rochester again proposes, and they are married. he eventually recovers enough sight to see their first-born son.""",dramatic

494,The Killing Fields,"""the film opens in may 1973 in the cambodian capital, phnom penh. the cambodian national army is fighting a civil war with the communist khmer rouge, a result of the vietnam war overspilling that country's borders. dith pran, a cambodian journalist and interpreter for new york times reporter sydney schanberg, awaits the arrival of schanberg at the phnom penh airport when he leaves suddenly. schanberg arrives after his flight is delayed for three hours in bangkok, thailand, and, irritated that pran is not at the airport, takes a taxi to his hotel. there he meets al rockoff, his photographer. rockoff doesn't know where to find pran and suggests they go to a nearby cafe to eat. while they sit and talk, an explosion happens nearby. al thinks a passing scooter's passenger threw a grenade, though the target isn't actually revealed. pran suddenly arrives and tells schanberg that an incident has occurred in a remote town, neak leung. allegedly, an american b-52 has bombed the town by mistake.after talking to the united states consul at the american embassy and finding out that the reports about neak leung are true, schanberg and pran try to find transport to the site. pran is able to sneak himself and sydney onto a police boat that takes them to neak leung. when they arrive, they find that the town has indeed been bombed and hundreds have been killed, with many more wounded, including women and children. schanberg and pran are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two khmer rouge operatives by cambodian army officers. they are eventually released and schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the u.s. army to report a sanitized version of the story.the story moves ahead two years, to april 1975. the international embassies are being evacuated in anticipation of an invasion of the capital by the khmer rouge. schanberg manages to secure evacuation papers for pran, his wife and their four children. however, pran insists that he stay with schanberg and help him continue his war coverage. pran's family is evacuated with the other international diplomats.on april 17, the khmer rouge move into the capital, seemingly under a banner of peace. during a parade through the city, schanberg, suspicious of the positive way the khmer rouge are being welcomed, meets rockoff, who tells him that he'd just come from an area where heavy fighting was taking place. at a makeshift hospital they see the result of the fighting""; many children and other citizens are injured by shrapnel and gunfire. as they leave the hospital they are met by a small unit of khmer rouge troops, who arrest them immediately. pran is at first not allowed into the armored personnel carrier with schanberg, rockoff, swain and their driver, but he is able to bribe the khmer rouge leader with his wristwatch. the group is taken through the city to a hidden courtyard where prisoners are being held and executed. pran, unharmed because he is a cambodian civilian, negotiates with the khmer rouge officer in command for several hours to spare the lives of his friends. they are set free, joining the thousands of refugees fleeing the capital. they do not leave phnom penh, but instead retreat to the french embassy and stay there for several days, awaiting their chance to evacuate.during this time they are informed that the khmer rouge have demanded that all cambodian citizens in the embassy be turned over. fearing the embassy will be overrun, the embassy occupants comply. knowing that pran will be imprisoned or killed, rockoff and fellow photographer swain vainly try to forge a passport identifying pran as a german citizen. without a current picture of pran, they use supplies they find in the embassy buildings;"" however, the picture fades because of the poor quality and age of the paper they use. with no other options available, pran is turned over to the khmer rouge and is forced to live under their totalitarian regime. all of the foreigners whom include the french, american, and most others are then expelled from cambodia.several months after returning to new york city, schanberg is in the midst of a personal campaign to locate pran. he has appealed to many humanitarian organizations and has kept in close contact with pran's family in san francisco.in cambodia, pran has become a forced laborer under the khmer rouge's """"""""year zero"""""""" policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. pran labors in rice fields under the watchful eyes of armed young children of both sexes, whom the khmer rouge hold in high regard as the future leaders of their regime. pran is also forced to attend propagandist classes where everyone undergoes re-education. as intellectuals are singled out and murdered or made to disappear, pran feigns simple-mindedness. eventually, he tries to escape from his work camp, but is recaptured. before he is found by members of the khmer rouge, he stumbles upon the infamous """"""""killing fields"""""""" of the pol pot regime"";"" endless acres of bones and blue plastic bags (used for suffocation executions) where millions of cambodian citizens

half the recognition for the award belongs to pran. in the mens room, he is confronted by rockoff who harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate pran and for using his friend to win the award. schanberg defends his efforts, saying that he has contacted every humanitarian relief agency possible in the four years since pran's disappearance. rockoff suggests that schanberg subtly pressured pran to remain in cambodia because pran was so vital to sydney's work. this accusation hits close to home, and schanberg begins to wonder whether he put his own self-interest ahead of pran's safety. he finally admits that pran """"""""stayed because i wanted him to stay.""""""""back in cambodia, pran is assigned to be the assistant to the leader of a different prison compound, a man named phat, and charged mostly with tending to his little boy. pran continues his self-imposed discipline of behaving as an uneducated peasant, despite several of phat's attempts to trick him into revealing his knowledge of both french and english. phat gradually begins to trust pran and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed.by this time, the khmer rouge are now engaged in a war with vietnam. the conflict reaches pran's region and a battle ensues between the khmer rouge of the compound and the invading vietnamese troops which are supported when two vietnamese fighter jets are

table"""""""".meanwhile, we hear meredith unsuccessfully trying to leave the stone family home, with the saab hitting a shrub, then a tree. julie starts to go to help her, but ben volunteers to head outside. he gets to the car, and says to meredith, """"""""well ma'am what seems to be the problem here?"""""""" she bursts into more sobs, and he tells her to move over and proceeds to take her to a bar.everett has lost his appetite. later, when he can't reach meredith, he decides to go and look for her. julie goes too.meredith and ben are getting loaded (drunk) at the local bar on dos equis beers. ben informs meredith that she really needs to relax. ben tells her that deep down she is a freak, she just doesn't let her flag fly. she drinks some more beers. she picks a song. she sits back down. she is getting drunk.julie and everett are having a walk and talking about life. everett is clearly taken with julie.meanwhile, back at the bar, in walks brad stevenson (amy's son) and his ambulance driving partner dave. meredith makes the brad connection, and demands they join them for beers. more julie and everett bonding. he is clearly unfulfilled and has lived the life he thought his family wanted him to live and be perfect and that has not entailed him living his life the way he has wanted to.now meredith's song comes on. she makes brad dance with her and invites him to christmas morning. she is now disheveled and wasted, and says it would be really great if they could get some pot to smoke and does ben know where they could get some.julie and everett walk back to the inn, where there is no meredith. everett invites julie for a cup of coffee, but she tells him that she cant do that, presumably because meredith is her sister.meredith and ben are now drunk and in the saab outside where ben tells meredith that in the dream she was a little girl shoveling snow, and that he was the snow and she was scooping him up.back at the inn, julie is in bed reading, and there is a knock at the door. its not everett but is kelly wanting to apologize to julie and to meredith for what went down back at dinner. back at the house, everett walks into the house, and sybil apologizes. he tells her that he doesn't believe that she is sorry. kelly comes home and sybil tells him that everett is super pissed. she tells him that she is scared of a lot of things, but mostly that he's getting married for the wrong reasons and she wont be around for it anyways. she slightly opens her blouse to reveal scares from a double mastectomy and kelly kisses her. everett tries to call meredith, she doesn't answer because she is sleeping on ben's shoulder in the saab.the next morning, it is christmas day. susannah and elizabeth want to open stockings. meredith wakes up, and realizes that she is in ben's bed and he is in the shower. she freaks, and freaks some more when kelly is knocking at the door to see when he came home since the saab is back in the driveway. he finally walks in, to find meredith in ben's bed, and turns and walks out sort of shocked.downstairs, everett is working on coffee when sybil comes in and gives him the ring. he remains pissed, when a shell shocked kelly walks in and is tossed out by sybil. more talk about wanting everett to be happy, when sybil drops the illness bomb again (implying that her cancer is advanced and will not recover), and everett has a breakdown about it. then julie comes in, and somehow in the scenario everett asks her to try on the stone ring, which she then cant get off her finger. chaos ensues, and julie is upset, no one understands why. then in walks meredith, when everett asks where shes been, she lies and says she just got there. the ring chaos continues, and julie and meredith go into the bathroom to get the ring off. then it all spills out. meredith thinks she slept with ben, julie tells her that the ring is her wedding ring and she says something like """"""""that's it?""""""""brad shows up and amy is angry with meredith for inviting him and how do you know him, etc. they were all at the bar, he tells the story. they are all gathering to open presents in the family room.the scene gets weird because meredith thinks that everett is going to propose and she's not up for it, so she rushes to give out her gift for everyone. they're all kind of shocked that she has gotten them a gift, then they open it as a group. she has gotten them all a framed photo of a pregnant sybil, and they are all shocked that she would give them such a thoughtful gift. sybil tells her that she has done good. she gets up to go do something, get away, and everett tries to go with her and she blurts out that she will not marry everett in front of everyone. then everett tells her that he wasn't going to ask, and then she blurts out that she slept with ben. then ben tries to tell them that they didn't sleep together at all, but then meredith leaves the room to go to the kitchen, sobbing about how humiliated she is.she tires to put her morton family meal in the oven, and now that they realize she's not a horrible person, amy and sybil feel bad for her humiliation and go to the kitchen, where they smack the kitchen door and hit meredith, and her dish falls all over her and all over the floor. she is crying more, asking them why they think they are better than her, and tells amy that she is the worst, then amy falls in the egg mess. meanwhile everett is chasing ben, they end up in the kitchen, where ben finally is able to tell him that they didn't have sex, and he slept on the floor. and why does he care really, he doesn't love her. sybil, amy and meredith hear this exchange, and obviously agree with this assessment.everett showers, julie finds out when the bus back to her home leaves that night. everett and meredith chat in his room, basically concurring that they're done. meredith goes to ben's room, and he invites her to sit on the bed. then he tells her to get out of her clothes which smell like puke, and she puts on a tee short and they lay and sing christmas songs. susannah's husband finally shows up. everett wonders where julie is, and elizabeth has the family ring on and fesses up that julie said goodbye. everett and thad and kelly go looking for her at the inn, then everett spots her across the way at the bus stop. he goes to her as the bus drives up and asks her to stay. she doesn't and the bus leaves. then the bus stops and she gets off and asks him what he's doing for new years.one year later. christmas eve.thad and patrick and their new adopted baby son pull up to the stone house in their range rover. they go into the house, where ben and meredith (now married) are waiting. susannah and her new baby are there along with elizabeth, as is dad kelly. in the living room are amy and brad stevenson (now married). sybil is nowhere in sight. amy is wearing a ring that sybil always wore throughout the movie (confirming to us that sybil is dead, having lost her recurring battle with breast cancer definitively). then everett and julie (also married to each other) show up. everyone is together and sort of smiling, and they are decorating the family christmas tree. they all leave brad and amy in the family room, where amy hangs an ornament that sybil had been staring at earlier in the movie.the end""",dramatic

50,Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,"""the story opens with an immense explosion somewhere in space. huge shock waves radiate out from the blast site. on board the uss excelsior, captain hikaru sulu (george takei) makes an official entry in his log, noting that his mission of """"""""cataloging gaseous anomalies in beta quadrant"""""""" is over and they are returning to earth. the ship is suddenly struck by one of the shock waves from the explosion. sulu orders his crew to restore control to the ship, which is done quickly. looking over their scanning equipment, the crew determines that the shock wave originated at the location of the klingon moon praxis. sulu remarks that praxis is the primary source of energy for the klingon empire, and orders a message be sent stating he and his crew will assist if necessary. they receive an emergency transmission from praxis showing a klingon worker consumed in flames. a second message comes from brigadier general kerla (paul rossilli) that acknowledges the explosion (he calls it """"""""an incident"""""""") and that they do not require assistance from the federation. he also commands them to stay out of the neutral zone. when one of the crew asks if they should report the incident, sulu replies """"""""are you kidding??""""""""on earth two months later, captain james kirk (william shatner), dr leonard mccoy (deforest kelley) and engineer montgomery scott (james doohan) attend a top-level meeting of starfleet. they are told that the klingon empire """"""""has roughly 50 years of life"""""""" remaining. charge of the meeting is turned over to the federation's special envoy, captain spock (leonard nimoy). he tells the committee that the explosion of praxis two months earlier has caused an environmental catastrophe on the klingon homeworld of q'ono's (kronos). pollution of the planet's ozone layer has left klingon civilization with only 50 earth years of oxygen. the klingon empire, due to its enormous military budget, is unable to reverse the devastation and has turned to the federation for assistance. however, as spock notes, assistance cannot begin until a treaty has been negotiated with the federation of planets to cease all hostilities between the two. spock, being the federation's envoy, had been speaking directly with chancellor gorkon (david warner) of the klingon empire to open treaty proposals.the committee is stunned by the news and debates whether starfleet will be dissolved. science and exploration will continue, however, military efforts will see a significant reduction. admiral cartwright protests, saying that the opportunity exists to """"""""bring them to their knees."""""""" spock counters, saying that a peaceful solution is more prudent. in the midst of the debate, it is announced that kirk will be sent in the enterprise to the outskirts of klingon space to escort chancellor gorkon's cruiser to earth for negotiations. kirk is wholly reluctant, despite spock's endorsement of him, saying an experienced ambassador should be sent, however, the council leadership ignores him and closes the meeting.after everyone has left the meeting, kirk confronts spock, demanding to know why spock chose him to escort the chancellor. kirk has a high distrust of klingons, who were responsible for the murder of his son, david marcus. spock believes that kirk, though an unlikely candidate for the mission, should still go, saying """"""""only nixon could go to china."""""""" kirk also mentions that the enterprise's crew was due to stand down (retire) in a few months.kirk gathers his crew and the enterprise leaves earth. new to the enterprise is lt. valeris (kim cattrall), a vulcan female officer, who is the first of her race to graduate at the top of her class, having been mentored and sponsored by spock himself. as the ship races towards the rendezvous point with gorkon, she and spock share a ceremonial drink in his quarters and discuss the turning point of federation relations with the klingon empire and their implications. spock tells her that logic does apply to the events at hand but there must also be some acceptance of faith that the new era will bring peace.the enterprise and gorkon's cruiser, kronos one, arrive at the meeting point. kirk hails the chancellor and invites him and his officers to dinner on the enterprise that night. lt. valeris mentions to kirk the availability of an on-board supply of romulan ale, which she suggests """"""""might make the evening pass more smoothly."""""""" kirk replies, """"""""officer thinking, lieutenant."""""""" the klingons are beamed aboard""; the chancellor has brought his daughter, azetbur (rosanna desoto), his chief of staff, general chang (christopher plummer) and kerla. though both sides are initially pleasant toward each other, and a few toasts to the peace accords and gorkon himself are made over romulan ale, the underlying hostility of both sides still permeates the conversation. the klingons themselves seem particularly fond of shakespeare;"" their philosophical arguments about the peace accords are laced with shakespearean thought. at one point chang announces that his people need """"""""breathing room"""""""", whereupon kirk mentions that the same thought was expressed by adolf hitler in 1939. azetbur speaks of the federation being a """"""""homo-sapiens-only"""""""" club, despite spock's presence. gorkon concludes that there is still much work to do. the klingons leave and the enterprise crew (literally) breathes a sigh of relief. chekov (walter koenig) mentions that their visitors had """"""""terrible table manners"""""""" and kirk says their own behavior, as humans, was fairly unacceptable as well.resting in his quarters (and making a log note that romulan ale is now banned from all diplomatic functions aboard the ship), kirk receives a call from spock to report to the bridge. hung over, kirk meets with spock, who tells him a huge, unexplained neutron radiation surge has been detected on a scanner. as spock and kirk try to find it's origin, kronos one is suddenly hit by a torpedo blast which appears to come from the enterprise. the klingon cruiser is hit again and begins to tumble helplessly, losing thruster power and their artificial gravity. on board kronos one, two figures, wearing starfleet space suits and magnetic gravity boots, beam aboard and begin to fire upon the klingon crew with phasers. several are killed, one is wounded, losing an arm. the assassins move through the ship, finding the chancellor's chambers. the two klingons with him are immediately killed, and gorkon is shot through the chest. the assassins walk back to the transporter pads and beam out, trailing some klingon blood with them.chang hails kirk and immediately accuses him of the attack on the ship. kronos one moves into an attack positions and activates its torpedo cannon, preparing to fire on the enterprise. kirk, knowing that the attack would be deadly and spark an interstellar war, surrenders immediately. he offers to come aboard kronos one and mccoy volunteers to go as well for medical assistance. as kirk leaves the bridge, spock surreptitiously touches his shoulder, placing a small object on his uniform. kirk and mccoy beam to kronos one and are escorted by kerla to the chancellor, who lies bleeding and dying on the deck. chang tells them about the assassination and accuses them of lying when kirk claims innocence. mccoy demands to treat gorkon and does, however, his unfamiliarity with klingon internal anatomy prevents him from doing more than reviving gorkon for a few moments. gorkon gestures for kirk to approach him and, putting his hand on the back of kirk's neck says """"""""don't let it end this way."""""""" he dies. chang immediately places kirk and mccoy under arrest for the murder under the federation's articles of interstellar law.on board the enterprise, uhura (nichelle nichols) reports the arrest. spock assumes command of the ship and orders a general standing down, knowing they cannot attack kronos one to rescue kirk and mccoy. uhura also receives a message from starfleet to return to earth immediately, however spock, wishing to investigate the attack on kronos one and gorkon further, discreetly orders uhura to report that the ship is experiencing multiple malfunctions and cannot return until they are repaired.on earth, the federation president meets with several other council members about the incident. among them is the klingon ambassador, who defends his government's arrest of kirk. the klingon ambassador also cites, as chang did, federation interstellar law. vulcan and romulan ambassadors sarek (mark lenard) and nanclus (darryl henriques) agree, as does the president, who does not want to provoke the already delicate relations with the klingon empire. a daring rescue plan, proposed by colonel west (rene auberjonois), is dismissed by the president as well. in gorkon's place, azetbur is appointed chancellor and talks directly to the president, saying kirk and mccoy will stand trial on q'ono's. she also affirms her reluctance to attend the peace accords, but agrees, saying that the location must be kept secret and that any attempt to rescue kirk and mccoy will be an act of war.the trial begins"";"" the prosecuting attorney is chang himself, while kirk and mccoy are defended by colonel worf (michael dorn, a cameo by the character from star trek: the next generation). chang delivers the charges, that kronos one was fired upon, the assassins came from the enterprise and that kirk ordered the attack. though worf successfully dismisses the final charge, chang is still able to lay the conduct of the two assassins on kirk, saying, as captain, he is responsible for the conduct of the crew under his command, one that kirk does not deny. when mccoy is questioned about his attempt to revive gorkon, chang attacks him verbally, challenging his medical expertise based on mccoy's age. he also cites the fact that mccoy, along with all the other dinner guests, consumed romulan ale that may have affected his ability to aid the chancellor. the most damning evidence that influences the trial is kirk's own words, possibly stolen from his personal log, where he stated """"""""i've never trusted klingons, and i never will. i can't forgive them for the death of my boy."""""""" the jury and court are swayed and kirk and mccoy are found guilty. though the klingons want the death penalty for kirk, the judge, in the interest of continuing peaceful negotiations with the federation, sentences the two to the klingon penal colony, rura penthe (""""""""the devil's graveyard"""""""") a remote and frozen asteroid deep in klingon space, where they will mine dilithium for the rest of their lives along with thousands of other klingon prisoners.on the enterprise, the bridge crew, at spock's request, watches video of the torpedo hits to kronos one. they determine that, though the memory banks of enterprise show two torpedoes had been fired and that all the torpedoes they were carrying before the attack have been visually accounted for, the shots must have come from another ship. the only ship capable of remaining undetected would be one with a cloaking device, a bird-of-prey, which cannot fire while cloaked. spock ascertains, through the logical statement """"""""once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"""""""" that the bird-of-prey that fired on kronos one can fire while cloaked. after further deduction, the crew knows what they must search for: the two pairs of magnetic gravity boats worn by the assassins. the crew begins to search every corner of the ship"";"" as they do, they are continually contacted by starfleet and ordered to return to earth. spock tells scotty to report that the enterprise is experiencing a warp drive malfunction. when scotty begins to protest, spock slyly but firmly tells them they need more time to search the ship. scotty heartily says it could take """"""""weeks"""""""" to repair. later, chekov finds dried klingon blood on the transporter pads and spock says they will also search uniforms. a pair of gravity boots are found in the locker of crewman dax, however his feet are largely different from human feet so the boots cannot be his.kirk and mccoy arrive on rura penthe. they are told that nothing can survive on the surface due to extremely cold temperatures, and a prisoner is cruelly thrown outside to prove the warden's point, freezing in mere minutes. a magnetic field above the asteroid prevents any unauthorized beaming to a ship. in the depths of the mine, kirk is threatened by a large alien who demands his coat. another prisoner, martia (iman), gets the thug to back off. later, kirk finds himself in a fight with another huge alien who is easily winning the battle. kirk kicks the beast in the knees and it falls down defeated. when he remarks he was lucky, martia tells him that he kicked the creature's in the genitals. later, after they go to bed, mccoy relates their plight to the """"""""no-win scenario"""""""" of the kobayashi maru test. kirk theorizes that the incidents that led them to their imprisonment may have something to do with others who fear the peace accords with the klingons. suddenly, martia appears and offers kirk the chance to escape. the next morning they go to a meeting place arranged by martia but do not see her. however, she is there, in the disguise of a large, hairy & ape-like alien. she later changes to the form of a young human girl, allowing her to slip out of her shackles. she takes kirk and mccoy through a hidden tunnel that leads to the frozen surface of the planet and gives them warm winter clothing. they begin a lengthy march that will put them beyond the magnetic field covering the prison.back on the enterprise, the signal from the device that spock secretly placed on kirk, a viridium patch, appears on a scanner and they set a course for rura penthe. in order to evade klingon security outposts, uhura, unable to use a universal translating device, must speak in klingon. she is able to fool a sleepy guard at an outpost and the enterprise continues to rura penthe.martia provides a flare for building a fire. kirk says he recognizes her as a """"""""chameloid"""""""", a shape-shifting species that were supposed to be mythical. kirk also hits her, knowing she plays to turn them over to the warden, who will execute them both for attempted escape and give martia a full pardon. martia changes into a likeness of kirk himself and the two fight. the warden and several guards appear. after a few moments of confusion about the identity of the real kirk the warden vaporizes martia with a blaster and is about to tell kirk who's behind the plot to kill him when he and mccoy are suddenly beamed to the enterprise. the ship streaks away from klingon space.spock brings them both up to date on his theory. as they make their way to the bridge, they find two crewmembers' bodies lying in a passageway, both killed by stun phaser shots at close range. scotty runs up, having found the missing uniforms with dried klingon blood, which belong to the two dead men. kirk and spock have a quiet discussion and set a trap for the crew members' killer. a shipwide announcement is broadcast, saying statements will be taken from the dead men in sickbay. their killer goes there and finds spock and kirk posing as the corpses. the killer is valeris and spock is visibly furious.on the bridge, kirk and spock interrogate valeris and discover she is part of a conspiracy to sabotage the peace accords and had stood outside kirk's quarters, recording the log entry used as evidence at his trial. she refuses to reveal the names of her cohorts""; spock performs a very intensive mind-meld and finds out that admiral cartwright, romulan ambassador nanclus and general chang are also part of the conspiracy. she does not know, however, where the peace conference will take place. the enterprise hails excelsior and sulu tells them that the conference will be held on the planet khitomer. valeris also reveals that there is only one bird-of-prey that can fire while cloaked, a prototype. detecting it will be difficult, however kirk orders a course set for khitomer, after warning sulu about the evasive ship. sulu says reaching them in time will be difficult but he agrees to help.the peace conference gets underway at camp khitomer. several of the conspirators are present, one of the klingons in the audience leaves the meeting hall and takes up a position above the speaker's podium and assembles a klingon sniper rifle. enterprise arrives at khitomer and is quickly hailed by chang in the prototype bird-of-prey. he taunts kirk with shakespearean dialog, saying that kirk prefers war to peace and opens fire on the enterprise. enterprise takes heavy damage and its shields quickly collapse. excelsior arrives shortly after the battle begins and provides distraction for chang. in the meeting hall on khitomer, azetbur gives an impassioned speech about her father's efforts to secure peace. in space, the bird-of-prey fires several more severely damaging blasts at the two federation ships. spock suddenly has an idea;"" he mentions that the bird-of-prey expels gas as it's exhaust. uhura suggests they use the equipment they have on board for studying gaseous anomalies and spock and mccoy equip a photon torpedo with the components. the torpedo is fired and homes in on chang's ship and scores a direct hit, crippling its cloaking device. both enterprise and excelsior destroy the prototype with photon blasts.on the planet, the federation president takes the podium while the klingon sniper aims his rifle at him. kirk, having beamed down with spock, valeris and scotty, rushes the stage and pulls the president out of the way just as the sniper shoots. as the sniper, seeking another target, points his rifle at valeris, scotty bursts into the room and shoots him. he falls through a glass window and onto the hall floor. the sniper is actually colonel west, wearing a klingon mask. kirk explains that they have evidence of the plot and that those involved were frightened of the potential changes that would result.later, the enterprise and excelsior head out into space from khitomer. kirk makes a last entry in his log, stating that this will be the last voyage of the enterprise. they communicate one last time with sulu aboard his ship before he takes a different course. they receive a transmission from starfleet ordering them to return to earth. spock suggests their reply be """"""""go to hell."""""""" chekov asks for a course heading and kirk says """"""""second star to the right and straight on 'til morning."""""""" the enterprise goes to warp and disappears. before the closing credits role, the signatures of the principle cast members appear on the screen one at a time.""",cult

""sador survives an assassination attempt by one of the captured nestors and launches all of his ships in retaliation against the planet. the akira ground troops, led by cowboy, defeat sador's army, but zed is killed in the fighting. there is another huge space battle and the mercenaries' ships are destroyed one by one. however, the mercenaries are successful in destroying all of sador's star fighters and the stellar converter, leaving only sador's flagship. shad and nanelia, piloting nell, are captured by the flagship in a tractor beam. the pair escape in a lifepod after shad orders nell to activate the ship's self-destruct program. sador's ship is destroyed in the explosion. as shad and nanelia return to akir, nanelia despairs over the deaths of their friends. shad tells her that the akira believe that no one is truly dead when they are remembered and beloved by the living. the akira will remember the sacrifices made by the mercenaries and honor them forever.""",cult

1337,The War Game,"""filmed in black-and-white with a running time of just under 50 minutes, the war game depicts the prelude to, and the immediate weeks of the aftermath of, a soviet nuclear attack against britain. the narrator says that britain's current nuclear deterrent policy threatens a would-be aggressor with devastation from vulcan and victor nuclear bombers of the british v-bomber force. a chinese invasion of south vietnam starts the war""; tensions escalate when the united states authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the chinese. although soviet and east german forces threaten to invade west berlin if the us does not withdraw, the us does not acquiesce to communist demands and the invasion takes place; two us army divisions attempt to fight their way into berlin to counter this, but the russian and east german forces overwhelm them in conventional battle. in order to turn the tide, president johnson authorises the nato commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, and they soon do so. an escalating nuclear war results, during which larger russian strategic irbms are launched at britain. the film remarks that many soviet missiles were, at the time, believed to be liquid-fueled and stored above ground, making them vulnerable to attack and bombings. it hypothesises that in any nuclear crisis, the ussr would be obliged to fire all of them as early as possible in order to avoid their destruction by counterattack, hence the rapid progression from tactical to strategic nuclear exchange. in the chaos just before the attack, towns and cities are evacuated and residents forced to move to the country. on september 7 at 9:15 a doctor visits a family with an ill patient. as he finishes checking up on her and steps outside the air-raid sirens start to wail in the distance, followed by a klaxon horn from a police car. the doctor rushes back in with two civil defence workers and starts bringing tables together to create a makeshift shelter. suddenly, the town of rochester is struck by an off-target 1 megaton soviet thermo-nuclear warhead aimed at raf manston, a target which, along with the maidstone barracks, is mentioned in scenes showing the immediate effects of the attack. the missile's explosion causes instant flash blindness of those nearby, followed by a firestorm caused by the blast wave. the air in the centre of the firestorm is replaced by methane and carbon dioxide and monoxide and the temperature rises to about 500 degrees. the firemen soon pass out from the heat in the chaos. by then the v-bombers carrying green bamboo gravity bombs and blue steel cruise missiles reach the border of the soviet union and presumably breach anti-aircraft defences by using a special instrument in their cockpits to jam defending radar signals. they head to their counter value targets, civilian cities. later, society collapses due to overwhelming radiation sickness and the depletion of food and medical supplies. there is widespread psychological damage and consequently a rising occurrence of suicide. the country's infrastructure is destroyed; the british army burns corpses, while police shoot looters during food riots. the provisional government becomes increasingly disliked due to its rationing of resources and use of lethal force, and anti-authority uprisings begin. civil disturbance and obstruction of government officers become capital offences;"" two men are shown being executed by firing squad for such acts. several traumatised and bewildered orphan children are briefly featured, questioning whether they have any future and desire to be """"""""nothing."""""""" the film ends bleakly on the first christmas day after the nuclear war, held in a ruined church with a vicar who futilely attempts to provide hope to his traumatised congregation. the closing credits include an instrumental version of silent night.""",cult

1116,The Long Voyage Home,"""the film tells the story of the crew aboard a british tramp steamer named the ss glencairn on the long voyage home from the west indies to baltimore and then to england. the crew is a motley, fun-loving, hard-drinking lot. among them is their consensus leader, a middle-aged irishman named driscoll (""""""""drisk"""""""") (thomas mitchell), a young swedish ex-farmer ole olsen (john wayne), a spiteful steward nicknamed cocky (barry fitzgerald), a brooding lord jim-like englishman smitty (ian hunter), and a burly, thoroughly dependable bruiser davis (joseph sawyer), among others. the film opens on a sultry night in a port in the west indies where the crew have been confined to their ship by order of the captain, yet they yearn as ever for an opportunity to drink and have fun with the ladies. drisk has arranged to import a boat-load of local ladies, who along with baskets of fruit, have agreed to smuggle bottles of rum on board where, with the acquiescence of the captain, the crew carouse until a minor drunken brawl breaks out and the ladies are ordered off the ship and denied any of their promised compensation. the next day the ship sails to pick up its cargo for its return trip to england. when the crew discovers that the cargo is high explosives, they at first rebel and grumble among themselves that they won't crew the ship if it is carrying such a cargo. but they are easily cowed into submission by the captain and the ship sails, crossing the atlantic and passing through what they all know is a war zone and potential disaster."" after the ship leaves baltimore with its load of dynamite, the rough seas they encounter become nerve-racking to the crew. when the anchor breaks loose, yank (ward bond) is injured in the effort to secure it. with no doctor on board, nothing can be done for his injury, and he dies. they're also concerned that smitty might be a german spy because he's so aloof and secretive. after they assault smitty and restrain and gag him, they force him to give up the key to a small metal box they have found in his bunk which they at first think is a bomb. opening the box against smitty's vigorous protests, they discover a packet of letters. when drisk reads a few, it becomes clear that they are letters from smitty's wife revealing the fact that smitty has been an alcoholic, disgraced and perhaps dishonorably discharged from his service with the british navy, and that he is now too ashamed to show himself before his family even though his wife urges him to come home. in the war zone as they near port, a german plane attacks the ship, killing smitty in a burst of machine gun fire. reaching england without further incident, the rest of the crew members decide not to sign on for another voyage on the glencairn and go ashore, determined to help ole return to his family in sweden, whom he has not seen in ten years. ""in spite of their determination to help the simple, gullible ole get on his ship for stockholm, the crew is incapable of passing up the opportunity for a good time drinking and dancing in a seedy bar to which they have been lured by an agent for ships in port looking for crew members. he has his eye on ole because he is the biggest and strongest of the lot. he drugs ole's drink, and calls his confederates in to shanghai ole aboard another ship, the amindra. driscoll and the rest of the crew, even though drunk and almost too late, rescue ole from the amindra, but driscoll is clubbed and left on board as the crew makes its escape with ole. the next morning, the crew straggles back somewhat dejectedly and resignedly to the glencairn to sign on for another voyage. a newspaper headline reveals that the amindra has been sunk in the channel by german torpedoes, killing all on board.""",cult

yelland believes so and owens and lasky immediately object to yelland's idea, stating that this type of interference in history could have very serious consequences, the most serious being that they could stop much of the pacific fleet from being destroyed. yelland grapples with the idea himself and determines that the nimitz, bound by its loyalty to engage all enemies no matter the place or time, will participate in the battle.meanwhile, the japanese prisoner converses with a japanese-speaking member of the nimitz' crew and demands access to a radio to contact his own superiors. at one point, chapman's golden retriever escapes from the room where his master is being held and runs into the room holding the japanese pilot. the pilot is able to disarm a marine guard and seize his rifle, opening fire and killing a few crew members. he reiterates his demands through the translator and holds several people hostage, including owens and lasky. owens is ordered by yelland to tell the pilot that they are from the future, citing his knowledge of the names of the ships of the japanese imperial fleet nearby. the pilot is temporarily overwhelmed by the news and is distracted long enough for marines to move in and kill him.yelland's intention of stopping the destruction of the american fleet at pearl remains unchanged. as a safety precaution and the method best determined to restore the space-time continuum to normality, chapman and scott will be left on a nearby deserted island while the attack takes place. a helicopter takes them out, with owens, to the island. scott and owens both jump out onto the sand, however chapman seizes a flare pistol and demands to be flown back to hawaii. a crew member tries to take the pistol, which goes off, causing the chopper to explode, killing chapman and the crew. owens and scott are stranded.back on the nimitz, yelland addresses his crew, telling them that they will engage the japanese air force as they attack pearl harbor. however, before the nimitz' strike force can be launched, the same sort of storm that propelled the nimitz through time appears again. the ship is consumed again and delivered to the same spot and the same date and time where it was initially displaced. the nimitz returns to pearl harbor and lasky is met at the pier. the door of a nearby limousine opens and senator chapman's dog, still on the nimitz when it was sent back into the future, jumps inside. lasky gets in the limo and sees both laurel scott and commander owens, both aged nearly 40 years. lasky is told by one of them that they """"""""have a lot to talk about.""""""""""",cult
452,Shivers,"""at starliner towers, a modern high-rise apartment complex on starliner island located just outside montreal, prospective tenants are welcomed by the smarmy manager merrick. in one of the apartment, dr. emil hobbes, attacks a young woman, named annabelle, who wears a school uniform. he strangles annabelle to death, slices open her stomach, and pours acid in before slitting his own throat.in another apartment, nicholas tudor, sits in front of a bathroom mirror, apparently suffering from stomach convulsions. tudor goes to annabelle's apartment, and recoils from the scene of carnage, but leaves without telling anyone about it.the two bodies are found by a resident doctor who calls the police. the resident doctor, roger st. luc, is quite calm about it as the paramedics carry the bodies away. st. luc goes to the office of hobbes medical partner, rollo linsky, who describes the project they were working on which rollo explains it as: """"""""a parasite that can take over the function of a human organ"""""""", and he also reveals hobbes' penchant for pedophilia, telling st. luc that he was once caught """"""""examining a young girl's breasts for cancer"""""""" when the girl was 12 years old.meanwhile, nick tudor's neglected and concerned wife, janine, seeks advice from st. luc about her husband's sickness and reluctance to see a doctor. at the same time, tudor leaves work early and goes home to starliner towers after more convolutions. at his apartment, he vomits what appears to be feaces over the balcony, just as two old women pass below. it thumps onto one of the women's umbrella, startling them. they think a dead bird landed on them due to the blood-stained splat on the umbrella. the fecal parasite slithers away into the undergrowth.in the laundry room of the building, an old woman investigates a trail of brown slime leading from an open window to a washing machine. as she lifts the lid, the parasite hurtles out and clamps onto her cheek. she tries to pull it off but cannot.at dr. st. luc's office, an elderly man complains to the doctor about stomach lumps saying that he may have caught them as a sexually transmitted disease from """"""""the girl in 1511"""""""" - annabelle brown.meanwhile, a distressed janine tudor visits her friend betts to confide in her about nick's recent behavior. betts tells janine to give nick some space while she clearly makes sly remarks to janine about how she looks. when janine returns to the apartment, nick has passed out on the kitchen floor after throwing up blood.in a corridor, two children play door knocking pranks until a parasite appears in the mail box opener at one of the doors (the tudor apartment) and the kids flee away in terror.inside the tudor apartment, nick callously dismisses janine's worry about his health. when he is alone, he lays on his bed and encourages his chest lumps to move, talking to them as if he is talking to a pet. meanwhile, betts runs a bath, listening to a radio announcement about the murder and suicide at starliner towers.in the building physician's office, dr. st. luc seems indifferent to the amorous advances from his nurse, miss forsythe. they are interrupted by the telephone. linsky calls st. luc from hobbes office downtown where he found hobbes notes, which far exceed their original project. according to linsky reading one paper, hobbes wrote: """"""""man is an animal who thinks too much"""""""", and had a vision about creating a parasite which was """"""""a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease that will hopefully turn the world into one mindless orgy"""""""". he was also using annabelle as a guinea pig for his experiment and that he infected with a parasite through sexual contact but when she got out of control he killed her since she could infect others with the parasites. st. luc tells linsky that apparently annabelle was very sexually active and infected three or four men at starliner towers and explains about the few cases of stomach lumps already and mentions that janine tudor's husband may have been one of annabelle's sexual partners. linsky arranges to meet them later in tudor's apartment to confirm and warns st. luc about encountering anyone at the building complex behaving in a strange way.meanwhile, betts continues to relax while soaking in her bath, unaware of the parasite forcing its way up through the plughole and heading right for the nearest orifice. betts screams and struggles as the bathwater turns red and thrashes in agony...at this point, the chaos really begins as it reaches inexorable ascendancy. nurse forsythe stabs a sex-crazed man who attacks her in her apartment. st. luc arrives just as the infected man flees. he takes a sample of the infected man's blood for the lab to examine.at the same time, a parasite attacks an old french-speaking couple in the corridor before being impaled on the end of the old lady's walking frame. soon, more assault by residents on others become more frequent. the old lady from the laundry room attacks a delivery man who shows up near her door. the infected delivery man then attacks a young woman and her little daughter in an elevator. then the delivery man and infected woman and girl attack and infect the lobby security guard, and so on...nick attempts to seduce janine, but she resists when she feels the lumps moving in his stomach. at the same time, st. luc finds the old french couple who tell him about their encounter with the parasite. while nurse forsythe keeps them company, the doctor the searches the basement dumpster where the old man claims to have threw the dead parasite, but gets ambushed by another infected man. dr. st. luc overpowers his assailant and unhesitatingly beats him to death.afraid over what is happening to nick, janine is standing by her man as he sleeps... until a bloody parasite emerges from his mouth onto the pillow beside her. in a state of shock, she runs out of the apartment and into betts... whom is also infected.nurse forsythe then leaves the elderly french couple and decides to try to leave from the building.st. luc goes to merrick's office and tells him to call the police. by now a zombie-like mob of people infected by the parasites is roaming all the corridors of starliner towers. the mob breaks into the old french couple's apartment and apparently infects them as well.in the basement garage, st. luc finds nurse forsythe about to be raped by the infected security guard, and he shoots the man in the back, killing him with a gun that he takes from the guard. after attempting to escape from the car park, they are rammed by one of the 'crazies'. they try to get out on foot, but find the garage door closed and locked, and several 'crazies' approaching them. they are forced to flee back into the building. st. luc and the injured nurse forsythe hide in the basement, waiting for the police to show up.in the lobby of the building, a young couple complains to merrick (clearly infected at this point) about the disturbances. he ushers them into his office where the couple are immediately pounced on by a delirious group of orgyists and are infected as well.in betts apartment, she comforts janine, stroking her hair and leaning in close. she tells janine that she always had a crush on her. as the two of them kiss, a parasite exchange takes place and janine becomes infected.a little later, linsky arrives at the starliner towers and hears distant noises, but nobody is around the lobby or anywhere else. he goes up to the tudor apartment and finds the door wide open. tudor is lying on the bed, his stomach seething with parasites. one of them lunges at linsky who tries tearing them off with pliers. as dr. linsky stabbs the parasite with a kitchen knife, he is attacked and beaten to death by tutor, who tears the parasite off the dead linsky's face and crams it into his own mouth as an act of ownership.in the basement, nurse forsythe relates a dream she had about an old man saying: """"""""he tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh, that disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other, that even dying is an act of eroticism"""""""". a parasite appears crawling out of her mouth, and st. luc knows right away that she is infected. he punchers her unconscious. as he carries her along a corridor containing storage lockers for the residents, the wooden wall panels burst apart and a sea of arms break through, reaching at them. st. luc is forced to leave the infected forsythe behind and runs to tudor's apartment. he encounters tudor in the kitchen kneeling over linsky's bloody corpse. st. luc shoots nick tudor dead. he then tries to escape from the building, but finds all the exits blocked. he encounters a gay couple trying to get at him, then an old man with a young girl in another apartment.st. luc makes his way to the indoor swimming pool where he sees the infected betts and janine there fooling around. st. luc finds an open patio door and walks out. sensing that he is free, he runs away from the pool area and outdoor patio and up a grass river embankment only to be confronted by hundreds of """"""""changed"""""""" people slowly and silently advancing towards him. forced to retreat back into the pool area, he is pushed into the pool where the infected betts, janine, and even nurse forsythe await. as the mob of 'crazies' jump in and attack him from all directions, st. luc finally loses his struggle to remain 'human' and allows the mob to consume him.in the final scene, the time is 5:26 a.m. about an hour before dawn as a radio announcement describes a wave of unexplained sexual assaults across montreal and the surrounding area which may have originated at starliner towers and that the authorities as well as the centers for disease control are currently investigating a possible epidemic of some kind. the final shots over the end credits show a long line of cars with infected people leaving starliner island and driving across the bridge leading to montreal and the rest of the outside world....""",cult

316,The Bad Seed,"""lovely, well-to-do christine bravo penmark has everything: a loving, well-paid husband with a respectable career (as an air force colonel, no less), a swank apartment in a respectable part of town, and an adorable, cherubic eight-year-old daughter. but as col. kenneth penmark leaves for an assignment in washington, dc, the strains that have lurked beneath the surface of the penmark household now begin to manifest. for example, her daughter rhoda gives every indication of being a grasping, greedy child, whom their landlady, monica breedlove, indulges with extravagant presents that rhoda gives some indication of not being satisfied with. for another, rhoda protests loudly and resentfully when reminded that she had lost a penmanship competition, saying that she ought to have won first place, and the medal that goes with that honor.the apartment-house handyman, leroy, presents another complication. though an adult, he seems to have an eight-year-old mind himself. he is also mean and spiteful, and regularly spars with rhoda.rhoda leaves for a school picnic, wearing two shoes that have been modified with iron plates to make them sound like tap shoes. as she leaves, leroy sprays her shoes with the garden hose, earning a stern reprimand from monica. leroy nurses resentment of mrs. breedlove, a lustful attitude toward christine, and a clear enmity toward rhoda.at the picnic, christine tries to sound out claudia fern, the headmistress of rhoda's school, about how rhoda is fitting in and getting along. miss fern at first is effusive in her praise of rhoda but then becomes evasive and abruptly excuses herself. christine confesses at this point that rhoda seems overly mature for her age, in a """"""""disturbing"""""""" manner.that afternoon, christine entertains her """"""""psychiatry club,"""""""" at which monica fairly boasts of having been under analysis by some of the most droppable names in the profession of psychiatry. (that she could actually have been a patient of sigmund freud, as she boasts, is a stretch, and her fellow clubbers seem to know it.) then, as the club starts to discuss a case of a recently convicted serial murderess, christine finds the conversation disturbing, prompting monica to tease her about it. the conversation then continues onto the case of one bessie denker, a name that christine recognizes but won't elaborate on.in the middle of this conversation, someone turns on the radio, and the announcer gives a shocking report: that claude daigle, a fellow student of rhoda's, has drowned on an old, rickety pier that the students had been forbidden to play on or near. as expected, the school bus brings rhoda home early--and rhoda, far from being in any to-be-expected state of shock, seems to care nothing about the death of her classmate, and casually asks for a peanut-butter sandwich and a glass of milk, and then goes out roller-skating. the one adult who takes the most notice of rhoda's casual attitude is the handyman, leroy. he says flat-out that she's not even sorry that he died, and rhoda half-innocently, half-sardonically asks why she should feel sorry. as she skates away, leroy forms a resolve to find something to scare her with, thinking only as an eight-year-old thinks, to """"""""take her down a peg.""""""""a few days later, claudia fern comes to visit christine, and to reveal some startling information: that rhoda was the last student to see claude daigle alive, and that claude's penmanship medal, which he had worn to the picnic, was now missing. miss fern also reveals that rhoda had been pestering claude all morning, trying to snatch his medal from him. furthermore, miss fern reveals that a lifeguard had shouted a warning to a girl answering to rhoda's description, as she was coming off the wharf.christine now remembers that claudia fern and her sisters never asked christine to pay for a share of the flowers for claude daigle's funeral, and miss fern states that she thought that christine would prefer to send flowers individually. now christine asks flatly why miss fern would take that attitude, and ask christine penmark about the missing medal. in reply, miss fern reveals what she had earlier not wanted to discuss with christine: that rhoda has no sense of fair play, is a sore loser, and has earned the enmity of all the other pupils in the school. furthermore, miss fern announces that rhoda will not be welcome when school takes up again in the following fall. this prompts christine to ask miss fern flat-out whether she supposes that rhoda had anything to do with claude's death. shocked, miss fern disclaims any such suspicion, but her behavior indicates that, whether she harbored such a suspicion or not, her sisters do.their conversation is interrupted when hortense daigle, the dead boy's mother, stumbles into the apartment, drunk and barely able to walk in a straight line, followed closely by henry daigle, her embarrassed husband. mrs. daigle sarcastically observes that christine is her social superior, an """"""""honor"""""""" that christine hastily disclaims, and then comes to the point of her visit: she demands to know what became of the penmanship medal, and what miss fern, concerned as she probably is with liability issues, won't reveal. mrs. daigle also reveals that claude, when found, had bruises on his hand and a crescent-moon-shaped wound on his forehead. in the end mrs. daigle becomes terrifically angry, and then almost collapses in tears, allowing her otherwise-ineffectual husband to lead her away. after hortense leaves, christine and miss fern have a tearful parting. shortly after this, col. penmark calls to ask about the accident, and to reveal that his washington assignment will last at least another four weeks.when monica calls and asks christine to lend her a locket that she had given rhoda, so that she can have its gemstone changed, christine is horrified to find the penmanship medal in rhoda's little """"""""treasure chest."""""""" she then shows the medal to rhoda and demands that rhoda explain how she came by the medal. rhoda at first tries to change the subject, then denies that she had had the medal, then tells a variety of stories that christine recognizes as false almost at once, and finally says that she had somehow persuaded claude to let her hold the medal, and then had gone out onto the pier and fallen in later on. in between these activities, rhoda indulges in a bit of flattery that now seems anything but flattering. then christine recalls a fatal accident that had happened to a neighbor in wichita, ks, an accident by which rhoda came into possession of a keepsake belonging to the neighbor. christine finally announces her intention to call miss fern, intending to surrender the medal, but rhoda, in a frightened tone, begs her not to, saying that the school officials don't like her and were persecuting her. miss fern is not available, and rhoda seems to care most of all about retaining the medal, insisting that she, not claude, had actually earned it.back in washington, col. penmark buys an expensive children's tea set for rhoda and has it shipped to rhoda, packed in excelsior. rhoda goes out to play with it, and takes the packing material with her. leroy sees her at play, and begins his scare campaign by accusing her of beating claude daigle with a stick and saying that she could never clean a murder weapon enough to remove all trace of blood, that the police have """"""""stick bloodhounds"""""""" that can find a thrown-away stick in any forest, and that the police laboratory will sprinkle """"""""blood powder"""""""" on a blood-soaked stick and make it turn blue. rhoda, for her part, gives leroy the excelsior, saying that she knows about the bed of excelsior that leroy has made for himself so that he can sleep on the job in the furnace room without being caught. nor is she afraid of leroy's accusations, saying that he made them all up. christine catches leroy talking to rhoda and warns him never to speak to rhoda again, or she will report him to monica breedlove.when rhoda comes back into the house, she asks her mother about police tests for blood. christine offers to ask miss fern about it, but again rhoda does not want christine to ask miss fern any such thing. christine instructs rhoda to go up to mrs. breedlove's apartment for dinner, while the famous psychiatrist reginald tasker dines in the penmark apartment with the local """"""""psychiatry club."""""""" mr. tasker reveals that he has great respect for christine's father, richard bravo, who had been quite an authority on crime and criminals in his younger days. tasker and bravo engage in good-natured professional sparring, and also discuss christine penmark's own dreams of writing a murder mystery. christine asks tasker whether children ever commit murder, and tasker says that they do, and even that many adult criminals begin their careers in childhood. christine insists that criminals are made in bad environments, but tasker insists that some criminals are born that way, that they are """"""""bad seeds,"""""""" possessing atavistic, consciousless minds, and even that one might inherit a tendency to criminality. richard bravo refuses to accept such a theory, but tasker politely stands by his theory, and even states that a child criminal would not present a sour countenance at all, but would instead present a quite convincing """"""""normal"""""""" and """"""""innocent"""""""" manner.then the conversation turns to the case of bessie denker, one of richard bravo's own case-history subjects. bravo wants to avoid the subject, but christine insists, and tasker reveals that ms. denker vanished without a trace before the authorities could make an arrest. tasker even remembers that ms. denker left a child behind, a part of the story that bravo hastily denies. shortly after making this revelation, tasker leaves.now that christine and her father are alone together, mr. bravo challenges christine with the worry that shows plainly on her countenance. now christine starts to talk freely of her fear of having been an adopted child, and not the actual daughter of richard bravo and his wife. christine also says that her concerns about rhoda have prompted a return of her old fear. she mentions a recurring nightmare that she had always talked to richard about, but mr. bravo clearly does not want to discuss it, and especially does not want christine to lend credence to the inherited-criminality theory.but now mr. bravo reveals that he did find christine in """"""""a very strange place."""""""" then christine reveals her recurring nightmare, about living in a farmhouse with her brother and a very beautiful lady, then not having a brother anymore, then being terrified of being in the room, then being outside in an orchard. finally she remembers the name she originally had: her name was not christine bravo at all, but ingold denker, bessie denker's daughter.this, then, is the truth: richard bravo found ingold denker, whom he renamed christine, in the orchard on the denker farm after bessie denker had died. but christine now feels that she would have done better to die, because she is afraid that she inherited a tendency to extreme criminality from her real mother, bessie denker--and passed this on to her own daughter, rhoda penmark.at this moment, monica breedlove returns with rhoda. rhoda greets her grandfather cheerfully, but now richard bravo takes a long, hard look at his granddaughter, though he will not explain his misgivings. bravo agrees to stay in a spare room in monica's apartment overnight.later, christine catches rhoda trying to dispose of something in a paper bag. rhoda doesn't want to reveal the contents of the bag, so christine struggles with rhoda and forces her to reveal what she had been trying to dispose of: her shoes with the iron half-moon reinforcements. now rhoda knows the horrible truth and extracts a confession from her: that rhoda killed claude daigle by beating him with her toe shoes, after he had refused to let her handle his penmanship medal. after the first blow, claude surrendered the medal, and then tried to escape, and rhoda struck him again, and again, until he fell in the water. when he tried to climb back onto the wharf, rhoda beat the backs of his hands with her shoes to make him let go, and so he drowned. rhoda also confesses something else: that she had in fact deliberately caused their neighbor in wichita to fall on some ice. christine, totally distraught, instructs rhoda to throw the shoes into the incinerator slot and say nothing to anyone. rhoda again asks about the medal, and christine half-promises not to give the medal back to miss fern.the next morning, richard bravo leaves, and leroy again tries to tease rhoda. this time leroy says that if the police find the stick with which she killed claude daigle, they'll sentence her to death in the electric chair, and even that the police have his-and-her child-sized electric chairs. next, leroy says that he hasn't seen her in her tap shoes, and now says that he knows that she hit claude daigle with the shoes, and even that he has retrieved them from the incinerator. that last boast causes rhoda to take alarm and demand that leroy return the shoes. at last leroy has found something to scare her with, and he presses his point--and finally realizes that she really did the deed, and that's the reason why she is scared and is demanding the return of the shoes.in fact, leroy did not retrieve the shoes when he said he did, but after christine chases leroy away from rhoda a second time, leroy opens the incinerator and finds the shoes, but is now too afraid to say anything. christine, for her part, reprimands rhoda for talking about this subject after they had agreed never to speak of it to anyone.when monica calls to give rhoda the locket, after it has been modified, rhoda asks permission to catch the ice-cream man and buy a popsicle. on her way, rhoda tries to steal several matches. christine tells her to replace them, but manages to hide two of them. when rhoda leaves, monica probes christine, knowing that something is troubling her, but not knowing what. monica offers to give christine some sleeping pills to help her sleep. christine collapses in a pool of tears, but still is afraid to tell monica anything. at that moment, hortense daigle, drunk as before, returns to the apartment, seeking yet another confrontation, not only with christine, but this time also with rhoda. hortense has by now tried to talk to miss fern a dozen times without result, and has also spoken to the lifeguard from the fatal picnic. what she now knows makes her firmly suspect rhoda of something, though she is not even sure herself what she suspects. hortense does not succeed in getting the information she seeks, or in scaring rhoda (because monica hastily takes rhoda away on a pretext). but she does succeed in frightening christine very badly before her husband finally shows up to take her home again.after hortense leaves, christine starts to call col. penmark, but despairs of having anything constructive to tell him. monica returns and reveals that she allowed rhoda to go out and buy another popsicle. rhoda then comes back into the apartment, crosses to the music room, and starts again to play her favorite tune, """"""""au clair de la lune,"""""""" on the piano over and over--slowly at first, and then faster and faster until she is playing it at break-neck speed. while she is playing, christine hears a man's voice from below, screaming at the top of his voice for someone to let him out. she then hears a desperate knocking from inside the sloping cellar door, and then sees a cloud of smoke emanating from that cellar. monica's brother emory and mr. tasker, who is still staying in the house, try desperately to break the cellar door open, but before they can get in, the screams rise to a blood-curdling crescendo and then stop. the owner of that voice was leroy, who has, quite simply, burned to death.christine now suffers a nervous breakdown and starts to strike the dining-room table with her right hand and babble about being blind, and finally screams at rhoda to stop playing that piano tune over and over. when rhoda does come out of the room, monica has to restrain christine from striking rhoda. christine then collapses in tears as she confronts the realization that rhoda has killed yet another person. but christine blames herself, not rhoda, because christine is now fully convinced that rhoda inherited her murderous tendencies from christine herself.that night, she induces rhoda to confess to killing leroy, which rhoda does, all the while insisting that the fault was not hers, but leroy's, because leroy shouldn't have scared her with his loose talk about police investigations, evidence, and little blue and pink electric chairs for children. christine reveals at this point that she has dropped claude daigle's medal onto the pilings at the pier where he drowned.finally, christine gives rhoda what she says are """"""""new vitamins,"""""""" but are actually sleeping pills, in an amount that is obviously an overdose. after putting rhoda to bed, christine shoots herself with col. penmark's revolver that they keep in the apartment. two days later, mr. bravo and col. penmark, both returned from their respective cities, discuss the apparent attempt at murder and suicide. rhoda recovers completely, but christine must stay in the hospital to recover. col. penmark takes rhoda home, but richard bravo asks the hospital doctor whether christine had mumbled anything while he was attending to her. the doctor remembers that she kept repeating the phrase """"""""bad seed"""""""" over and over. mr. bravo says that christine was about to write a book about inherited criminality, but the doctor, as mr. bravo had done, totally rejects the theory, saying that no one would dare bear or adopt children if that were the case.col. penmark puts rhoda to bed and then waits up. he takes a call from the hospital, as christine desperately wants to confess to kenneth that she has """"""""sinned a great sin."""""""" the colonel says that whatever the problem is, they will face it together.rhoda, meanwhile, has put on her raincoat and sou'wester and gone out of the house. she walks all the way to the fern school grounds, and onto the wharf where claude died. rhoda wants, quite simply, to retrieve the medal. using a flashlight, she spots the medal underwater, and takes an old fishing net to try to snag it. lightning strikes her and knocks her into the water.the movie, as such, ends here--but then a casting-call sequence appears in which the actors playing the various parts introduce themselves. rhoda appears next to last, and finally christine--but then christine steps toward rhoda, seizes her, turns her over her knee, and gives her a sound spanking. the last

160,Chasing Amy,"""holden mcneil (ben affleck) and banky edwards (jason lee) are comic book artists and lifelong friends. holden is the calmer, more reasonable of the duo"";"" banky, meanwhile, is the caustic and short-tempered half. the story opens at a comic book convention in new york city where the two are promoting their latest comic series 'bluntman and chronic'. during a panel discussion, they meet alyssa jones (joey lauren adams). she is a struggling comic book writer whom is friends with the african-american comic book writer and activist hooper (dwight ewell) who puts on this militant image to hide his flamboyantly gay personality.that evening, the four go out for drinks together at a local bar where holden is attracted to alyssa based on their conversation during a dart game. through hooper she invites holden to a get together at a bar she frequents. banks comes along and while there alyssa is asked to sing a song. during the song banky notices that they are in a female gay bar and that alyssa is singing the love song to a woman in the audience and not to holden who thinks the song is for him. the four of them end up at a booth and alyssa and banky have an involved conversation about sex with women and holden is visibly upset about alyssa being a lesbian. however, they have discovered they are both from the same area of new jersey and the two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops. during their discussions it is clear that holden has a very narrow heterosexual view on male female relationships and sex in general. the new friendship does not sit well with the homophobic banky, who dislikes and distrusts alyssa and is bothered by the relationship that develops between her and holden. holden and banky's business relationship suffers as well -- the two had been on the verge of signing a lucrative deal to turn bluntman and chronic into television show and banky feels that holden is no longer taking their combined efforts or the tv show seriously.eventually, holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to alyssa. she is initially angry with him and walks away.holden follows her and they have a heated discussion about their relationship and she walks away again. holden is confused and while returning to his vehicle alyssa runs up, they embrace and that night the two begin a romantic relationship. banky walks in the next morning and finds them together sleeping on his couch in the studio. this new development worsens the tension between holden and banky who distrusts alyssa and that his friend is going to be hurt when the relationship fails. banky runs across an old friend who grew up with alyssa who tells him a sexual adventure story from alyssa's past. banky reports to holden that alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which earned her the nickname """"""""finger cuffs"""""""" for getting it from both ends. holden is deeply disturbed by this revelation, having believed based on their conversations about love and sex that he is the first man alyssa had ever slept with.holden asks advice from hooper who tells him that if he wants his relationship with alyssa to work, he must be honest and truthful as to put whatever is bothering him behind him by being up front with her about it and then put it behind him. hooper also tells holden he believes the issues with banky is that banky is jealous and in love with him and that his macho sexual banter is a disguise for his true feelings.the following evening, holden confronts alyssa while attending a hockey game and he clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing in the stands. during a tearful argument in the parking lot, she tells holden about her youthful sexual experimentations involving men. she apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with but justified it by saying she could see that he took pleasure in the thought. however, she refuses to apologize for her past, and holden leaves feeling angry and confused.later, during lunch at a local diner with the local stoners and drug dealers jay and silent bob (jason mewes and kevin smith), who were the inspiration for the bluntman and chronic comic book characters, holden gives them their monthly residual pay for sales of the comic book. here he confides in them about his troubled feelings and relationship with alyssa. speaking more than one line for the first time, silent bob mentions chasing amy and reveals that he was once in a relationship """"""""a couple of years ago"""""""" which was similar to holden's. despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, amy, his insecurities about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her. angry at himself for letting her go, he has """"""""spent every day since then chasing amy"""""""".inspired by silent bob's story, holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with alyssa and his fractured friendship with banky. he invites them both over and tells alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend. he also tells banky that he realizes that banky is in love with him... kissing him passionately to prove the point. holden suggests that the three of them should have sex with each other in a threesome so he will no longer be envious of alyssa's broader experiences and it will resolve banky's issues with them as a couple. banky reluctantly agrees to participate. alyssa is appalled and refuses, at which banky expresses his relief. alyssa tries to explain to holden why his plan is so wrong. before leaving, she states that she will always love him but her past is in the past and she will not be his whore and slaps him across his face. banky then leaves without saying a word.one year later, the story has banky busy promoting his own new comic book at a convention in new york. it is revealed that holden has dissolved their partnership over bluntman and chronic, leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of 'jay and silent bob strike back'). banky looks over and sees holden at a distance, who silently congratulates him for his success on the new book. banky gestures over to a booth hosted by alyssa, and provides wordless encouragement with a hand gesture implying a coming together to holden to go talk to her. holden has a brief tender emotional conversation with alyssa, and gives her a copy of 'chasing amy', his new comic based on their failed relationship. holden asks her to contact him. after holden leaves, alyssa's girlfriend (virginia smith) comes back to the booth and asks who that was. alyssa feigns

for minorities to travel back then. they move on, daisy has given hoke the wrong directions, and has held back their journey for a little while. hoke tells daisy he needs to use the bathroom on the side of the road, since coloreds cannot use filling station restrooms, but she refuses to let him do so. hoke lays his foot down that he needs to go and that he's almost 70 years old and doesn't need to be treated like a nobody or a child. daisy and hoke make it to walter's and celebrate the birthday.it is may of 1963. hoke is paying a visit to boolie's textile factory. as her walks through, the old textile weaving machines have been replaced by more efficient saco-lowell spool machines with fewer workers needing to tend to them. hoke reveals a wife of boolie's cousin is trying to hire him and to """"""""name his own salary"""""""". boolie catches on and realizes hoke is really asking for a raise. he's offered $65 a week, but hoke asks for $75 and boolie agrees to it. hoke is exceptionally pleased and thanks boolie for it and having been fought for.soon afterwards, daisy's longtime cook and housekeeper idealla dies in her kitchen of a heart attack while shelling peas. she, hoke, boolie, and florine attend the funeral at idella's missionary baptist church to pay their respects.that night, daisy is in the kitchen preparing a meal of fried chicken, biscuits, rice, and okra for her and hoke. hoke is now helping her out with the household tasks, including setting up a garden, which daisy previously protested.sometime in the winter of 1963 or 1964, a rare snow and ice storm is ravaging atlanta. daisy's electricity is out in her home, but hoke comes to work that day anyway and with some coffee from the krispy kreme. her son calls to check on her and surprised at her kind comments about hoke coming over to help and insults her for it.*about january of 1965, boolie is awarded businessman of the year by the atlanta business council detailing of his grandfather werthan starting the business on decatur rd. and where it is now.*daisy's car is now a blue 1965 cadillac sedan deville. she and hoke have been stuck in traffic. daisy does not get to go to the jewish temple for worship and it's revealed to her the temple was bombed. she does not seem to understand why, but realizes after hoke tells her a story of a boyhood friend of his whose father was hanged that she is almost as much a victim of racism and prejudice as he is.boolie pays a visit to daisy at her home revealing his reluctance to attend the speech of martin luther king, despite his admiration for him, because it might hurt his business clientele in the future. he suggests she asks hoke to go, despite her reluctance.*on january 27, 1965, daisy attends a speech by martin luther king at the dinkier plaza hotel. on the way there, she indirectly offers hoke to join her, but he is offended at her for doing it at the last minute and that times have not really changed all that much, despite her claim that they are. instead, she attends the speech alone and hoke sits in the car listening on the radio. daisy realizes from the speech that she is probably more guilty of what's happened over the years than the overt racists that have said hateful things and incited violence.it is the fall of 1971. hoke is now driving daisy's 1965 cadillac and her car is now a 1970 cadillac fleetwood. by this time, he is in his early 80's and she is 95 years old. he enters her home with his usual morning greeting, but she does not respond at first. soon afterwards, she comes downstairs still in her nightgown and thinking she's a schoolteacher needing to find graded papers. suffering from dementia, hoke calls boolie to come over to help. after having calmed down and with her mind back in place, daisy declares hoke as her best friend and that it's sincere. she takes his hand.thanksgiving day, november 22, 1973. hoke is now about 85 years old. his glasses are very thick. his granddaughter michelle is dropping him off at daisy's house, which has just been sold. boolie is now about 60 years old and driving a 1973 mercedes. he and hoke have one last visit to the now empty house. boolie takes him over to the retirement home daisy is staying at. by this time, she is 97 years old and using a walker. she barely acknowledges their presence at fist, but later insists hoke stay with her alone. mostly small talk, but they are enjoying each others company. hoke gently feeds her pumpkin pie she has not yet eaten and the screen fades to an old automobile of daisy's driving away. this is possibly the last time they saw each other.*boolie's award of 1966 businessman of the year should have been 1965. the speech given by martin luther king was on january 27, 1965 at the dinker plaza hotel, but in this movie, it's 1966, which was an error. also, the reformed jewish temple was bombed in atlanta on october 12, 1958, but it happened in this movie in 1966, probably as a preceder to the martin luther king speech about racism.""",dramatic

rabbit in disguise. as they drive to the place where the governor's speech is held, as they get to the goods, they learn that they've already been had.that night, as they learn the shut down is unavoidable, they proceed to have one last party at the station and get really drunk. in the locker room, they're stunned to learn that farva has switched sides and has become a local police officer. furious, they hog tie farva and take his cruiser out for a joyride, making a stop at dimpus burger and a couple of other places, including grady's house, where a way too drunk o'hagan wants to throw down fisticuffs with grady. ursula calls them on the radio. she is finally able to tip them off to what grady and her fellow officers have been up to. foster thinks that ursula was the one who told grady about the extra marijuana in the winnebago but it wasn't.they drive to a remote area where they witness a plane that has just landed. farva finally manages to free himself to stall them. but a drunk ramathorn ensures farva that if he helps them, he could be a hero in all of this. as they're watching the events unfold, grady goes to meet the pilot of the plane which has canadian designations and identifiers. ursula meets up with the troopers and tells o'hagan that she was the one who gave the troopers all those anonymous tips - about the college kids, the winnebago, and the bunty soap company, that they're all linked to her boss. she's grown incredibly tired of the fact that they constantly put her on the radio and give her no field work. the other local officers are then seen unloading more giant bricks of marijuana from the plane into another semi that bears a striking resemblance to the bunty soap truck that they pulled over, and they finally figure out that grady has been using the spurberry police department to run protection for a huge drug ring. they then enact a plan to arrest the officers which then leads to a huge drunken brawl between the two departments. but unfortunately with no weapons, they search farva's cruiser for anything they can for a distraction only to find a blow up doll and a few flare guns. o'hagan is glad to put the handcuffs on grady and read his rights.the next day, the troopers are gathered at o'hagan's house where he is about to read a congratulatory letter from the governor. unfortunately, despite the good they've done in tearing down police corruption, the governor still plans to shut down the department for good. several months pass. we see ramathorn and foster operating a beer delivery service and are transporting a keg to a college frat party, which is held at the house of the guys that they had picked up going to canada. they are seen as being rather mean to the former highway patrol men. ramathorn, tired of their antics, finally pulls off the uniforms that he and foster were wearing and reveal themselves to be the new local police. farva, ursula, mac, and rabbit arrive and they have a huge party.the movie ends with a post credits scene that shows the incident that got farva suspended in the first place by attacking a school bus full of kids. the incident was caught on the surveillance camera on farva's police cruiser.""",cult

with a young girl to impregnate her. when he refuses, the atoll's council of elders become suspicious and decide to detain him. when he's grabbed by two men, they discover he's a mutant, with webbed feet and gills behind his ears. declaring him abominable, they begin to beat him. the mariner fights with a few guards, plunging into the lagoon with one of them, killing him when the man draws a knife. he's hauled out of the water and beaten further until the enforcer stops them, saying its not their way to dispense this type of judgement.later that night, while in a cage, the mariner spots nord leaving the atoll unannounced. he's visited by helen & enola's friend, gregor, the atoll's scientist, who wants to study him - the mariner remains unfriendly. helen visits him as well, asking if he'll take her & enola if he leaves. he asks her to give him a dock cleat to pick the lock on his cage. helen refuses.the next day the council has decided that the mariner is a danger to them and he's to be dropped in the recycling muck and drowned. just then, an armada of smokers, led by the deacon, launches a huge attack on the atoll. the compound dwellers are outnumbered and out-armed. during the battle, the mariner's cage is dropped into the muck when a smoker launched over the wall collides with it. as he sinks, drowning, helen tells him she'll free him if he takes herself & enola with him. she opens his cage and they both work together to get enola onto the boat and allow it to escape the compound. they barely manage to get the gates open and flee. the deacon spots them and orders his fleet to attack his boat. the mariner fires a harpoon at the armada's primary gunship, using a cable to turn its guns on the deacon's boat which is loaded with gasoline. the boat explodes throwing the deacon off. the mariner, enola & helen escape.back at the wrecked atoll, the deacon, now wearing a bandanna to cover a lost eye, interrogates one of the dwellers and finds out that enola escaped aboard the mariner's boat. the deacon assigns his fleet a new mission to find enola.aboard the mariner's boat, the mariner tells helen that she can stay but enola should be thrown overboard. helen offers her body to the mariner but he declines. when she picks up a harpoon gun and tries to hold him hostage, he drops his sail on her & hits her underneath it with an oar, knocking her out.aboard the deacon's vessel, the deacon finds out that they are rapidly running out of oil for refining. the deacon resolves to find enola and their way to dryland, which is a matter of survival. he orders two of his crew to take the small plane they have aboard their vessel & scout the area for the mariner's boat. while searching, the pilot & his comrade find the mariner's boat. while the mariner prepares a counterattack so the pilot can't give their location away, helen shoots the plane with a mounted harpoon gun. the plane begins to circle the mariner's boat, entwining the harpoon's cable in the sail rigging, threatening to wreck the vessel. the mariner climbs his mast and tries to shoot the plane down, but is thrown into the ocean when the pilot is able to shoot & sever the cable. the mariner, furious at helen's incompetence, viciously cuts her hair short. when enola protests, he does the same to her.some time later, the mariner spots another sailor. helen loudly says that they may be able to trade with the man for food and they stop to talk to him. the man turns out to be somewhat paranoid and neurotic and, at first, wants to trade some sheets of paper for sex with enola. helen & the mariner refuse & helen agrees to have sex with the man belowdecks. the mariner reads the sheets of paper, which are pages from national geographic magazine & are strikingly similar to pictures that enola had been drawing, indicating that she's been on dryland. the mariner negates the deal with the drifter for sex, rescuing helen. when the man tries to fight his host, the mariner kills him and salvages items from his boat.helen still insists that she & enola need food. the mariner preps a harpoon gun and jumps off the back of the boat, using himself as bait. a large sea creature swallows him live and he kills it with a couple of blasts from his gun. he feeds helen and enola the flesh from the giant creature. while he cooks extra meat for storage, enola notices his webbed feet, saying she'd like to have feet like his. when enola suggests that the mariner isn't talkative & a bitter loner, he tells her she doesn't listen enough to the world around her.after a few days enola and the mariner come to an understanding that leads to a friendship. he teaches enola to swim, something she'd never been trained to do.a few more days after, the three come to an outpost. the mariner tries to communicate with them but the inhabitants don't respond verbally and simply keep waving. the mariner uses an underwater periscope and sees smokers hiding below the outpost, which had recently been pillaged by the deacon and his crew. the mariner raises his sails and sets off, barely escaping the smokers and their high speed vehicles. the deacon takes aim with a rifle and hits the mariner in his side, wounding him.the deacon decides to let them escape, believing it won't be very long before they catch up to them.helen grows impatient, wanting to know when they'll find dryland. the objects on the mariner's boat and the dirt he'd sold at the atoll convince her that he can take them directly there. the mariner says he's sailed to just about every point on the globe and has never found it, however, he will show her where he got the objects and the dirt. he fashions a crude diving bell and takes helen into the depths of the ocean, showing her a long-sunken city (denver, colorado) where there is plenty of dirt and items like the ones he's found. when they surface helen mentions that she never wanted to believe the legends she'd always heard that the world was covered with water in a cataclysm rather than being created that way.suddenly the deacon and his crew appear. enola is already hiding and helen and the mariner are used as bait to flush her out. enola is taken and the mariner and helen jump overboard. the mariner kisses helen, using his gills to breath for them both until their attackers have left. helen and the mariner stay on the flotsam of his boat until they're found by gregor, the scientist from the atoll, who'd escaped in a crude hot air ballooned-vehicle. he takes them to a group that had also escaped the atoll attack and have joined their boats together in a makeshift atoll. helen and the mariner try to convince everyone that the world was not created in a flood but covered by it, a blasphemous concept. they all agree that they must find enola and use the markings on her back to find dryland. the mariner agrees to find the deacon's vessel and rescue the girl.the mariner arrives at the deacon's boat, an ancient tanker. the deacon has stirred his crew into a frenzy with a rousing speech about finding the path to dryland. the crew begins to row frantically with giant oars, not knowing that the deacon hasn't yet deciphered the markings on enola's back. he holds her prisoner in the bowels of the ship, threatening to kill her. enola counters, saying the mariner will come to save her.the mariner is able to infiltrate the ship and find the topside deck. he approaches the deacon's perch on the bridge and demands to have enola back. the deacon believes he's bluffing, until the mariner produces a flare, holding over one of the vents leading to the tanker's oil supply. when the deacon mocks him, the mariner drops the torch, igniting the remainder of the oil, causing the ship to burn. the deacon grabs enola and tries to escape in his plane, but the mariner stops him with a old anchor and cable, downing the plane. the deacon jumps off his boat as it sinks, finding an old jet ski. just as the boat is about to sink, enola & the mariner are rescued by gregor and helen in gregor's flying ship. as they watch the ship sink from the air, they see the name """"""""exxon valdez"""""""" on the stern.the deacon uses a pistol to hit the small craft, throwing enola off and into the water. he sees that three of his crew are nearby on jet skis and they race toward enola. the mariner ties a long bungee cord to his ankle and jumps down, grabbing enola just before the deacon and his crew collide and their jet skis explode.the mariner and enola are pulled up. gregor looks over the tattoo on enola's back and determines the direction they need to follow to dryland. everyone falls asleep and the craft drifts through the air for a few days. when it seems hopeless that dryland will be found, the mariner sees a seagull on the the craft. they drift through some clouds and see a mountainous island. on the shore, they find a tropical landscape with fresh water and food. the enforcer finds a small hut in the woods with a couple of skeletons. enola recognizes the home as her own. the enforcer suggests that they bury the dead inhabitants, enola's parents, because it was their tradition.the mariner decides to leave, being more comfortable on the ocean. he builds a smaller boat than his trimaran and says a tearful farewell to enola. he promises to find more atoll dwellers and drifters and bring them back. in the extended version of the film, enola and helen watch him sail off from the island's mountaintop where there is a plaque saying that they're on the summit of mt. everest.""",cult

1015,Volcano,"""at los angeles, an earthquake strikes. michael roark, the director of the city's office of emergency management, insists on coming to work to help out with the crisis, even though he has taken a vacation with his daughter kelly. his associate, emmit reese, notes that the quake caused no major damage, but seven utility workers are later burned to death in a storm drain at macarthur park""; one escapes and survives but is severely burned on one side of his face. as a precaution, roark tries to halt the subway lines which run parallel to where the deaths took place, but los angeles mta chairman stan olber opposes, feeling there is no threat to the trains. against regulations, roark and gator harris venture down the storm sewer in the park to investigate. they are nearly burned alive and barely escape with their lives when hot gases suddenly spew out of a crack in the concrete lining and floods the tunnel. geologist dr. amy barnes believes that an underground volcano may be rapidly forming beneath the city with magma flowing underground (similar to the formation of the mexican volcano parícutin which emerged and grew tremendously in just one week.) unfortunately, she has insufficient evidence to make roark take action. the next morning, at around 5:15 a.m., barnes and her assistant rachel venture in the storm sewer to investigate the scene of the incident, where they discover the crack in the ground which released the gases earlier. while they are taking samples, a more powerful earthquake strikes and rachel is killed when she falls into the crack that is engulfed by a rush of the hot gases. near the la brea tar pits, smoke rises out along with lava bombs. steam explodes from the sewer system, while a subway train derails underground, trapping the passengers inside and exposing them to the severe heat and toxic gases, which causes them all to eventually pass out. roark helps injured firefighters out of the area. moments later, a newly formed volcano erupts from the tar pits and lava begins to flow freely down wilshire boulevard, incinerating everything in its path, including roark's truck and an lafd fire truck downed by a lava bomb, killing two firefighters who are trapped inside. roark and his daughter become separated as she is injured when a nearby lava bomb sputters and burns her leg, and she is taken to cedars-sinai medical center by dr. jaye calder. meanwhile, olber leads his team through the red line tunnel to the derailed train to look for survivors. they manage to save everyone, but olber notices that the train driver is still missing and goes back; he finds the driver still alive but unconscious, just as the lava reaches the train and begins melting it. olber sacrifices his life to save the driver by jumping into the lava flow, throwing the driver to safety as he burns to death. roark, barnes, and police lieutenant ed fox devise a plan to stack concrete barriers at the intersection of wilshire boulevard and fairfax avenue, creating a cul-de-sac to pool the lava as helicopters dump water on it to form a crust, making the operation a success. but barnes notices that the volume of ash falling is intensifying for the eruption to be over. she later theorizes that the magma is still flowing underground through the red line subway extension, and calculates that the main eruption will occur at the end of the line at the beverly center near cedars-sinai. to prove this, dr. barnes and roark lower a video camera into the tunnel to watch it, only to be incinerated by a fast-moving flow of lava. they calculate the speed and realize that they have thirty minutes until the lava hits the end of the red line. through roark's direction, explosives are used to create channels in the street to divert the flow of lava into ballona creek, which will later flow into the pacific ocean, but barnes realizes that the street is sloping in the opposite direction. roark engineers another plan to demolish a 22-story condominium building (which is currently under construction by jaye's husband) to block the lava's path from entering the city. gator refuses to abandon an lapd swat cop who has gotten trapped under a core column while slotting explosive charges just as the lava reaches the dead end of the subway tunnel extension and explodes out of the ground in a massive geyser; he sacrifices their lives to detonate the final explosive charge. roark then spots kelly nearby, trying to retrieve a small boy who wandered off, putting them in the path of the collapsing building. roark barely manages to save both of them from being crushed as the building collapses. the plan is successful and the lava flows safely to the ocean. roark escapes from the wreckage with kelly and the young child. the death toll is nearly a hundred people, and thousands injured. it starts to rain, with surviving civilians having a sign a relief. roark tells reese he's on vacation and to tell the chief that too. reese soon returns to work.

""the baron invites sayuri to his estate for a sakura-viewing party, which mameha is reluctant to let sayuri attend but lets her go anyway. when the baron presents a kimono to sayuri in private at the party, he undresses her against her will in order to """"""""take a look"""""""", but does not go any further."" sayuri's mizuage is won with a record-breaking bid of fifteen thousand yen. mother, seeing sayuri as a financial asset, names her as her adopted daughter and heiress to the okiya. this crushes pumpkin, who was hoping that she would get adopted so she could have security in her old age, and enrages hatsumomo. she is then told by mother that she must give up her spacious room to sayuri, which further outrages hatsumomo, who tries to remind her of her previous financial contribution. mameha later tells sayuri that the bid had ended up a contest between dr. crab and the baron, nobu having refused to partake in the bidding because it was against his principles. mameha let it go to dr. crab because of her romantic feelings for the baron, despite his bid being even higher. when returning home from the mizuage ceremony, sayuri finds a drunken hatsumomo in her room, where she has found the chairman's handkerchief. a fight ensues, during which a gas lantern is knocked over and ignites a fire, and the okiya is partially destroyed by the flames. hatsumomo is then kicked out of the okiya by mother, her belongings given to sayuri, and she is banished from gion with her fate left unknown. sayuri's successful career is cut short by the outbreak of world war ii. sayuri and mameha are separated, with sayuri going to the hills to work for a kimono maker, an old friend of nobu's, and mameha going to a physician, the chairman's old friend. after the war, sayuri is reunited with nobu, who needs her help with impressing an american colonel named derricks (ted levine) who has the power to approve funding for the chairman's firm. sayuri reunites with mameha, who now makes a living renting rooms for the poor. although she is reluctant to return to the geisha lifestyle after what she's been through, she agrees to help impress derricks. sayuri is reacquainted with pumpkin, who is now a flirty escort. sayuri goes on a trip with nobu, the chairman, mameha, pumpkin, and the americans to the amami islands. at amami, the colonel propositions sayuri, but is rejected. nobu witnesses the incident and confronts sayuri. he finally confesses his feelings, telling her that he wants to become her danna. knowing that entering into a relationship with nobu will destroy any chance of her being with the chairman, sayuri is distraught and devises a plan. mameha catches on to it and warns her against it because of the kindness nobu has shown her. she wants sayuri to accept him as her danna and not end up like hatsumomo did. she refuses and enlists pumpkin's help to have nobu catch her seemingly being intimate with the colonel. however, because of her secret resentment of sayuri, pumpkin brings the chairman instead, having full knowledge of sayuri's feelings towards him. when sayuri confronts her, pumpkin coldly tells her that she did a lot of favors for her in the past and she stole her chances of being adopted by mother. she hoped by having the chairman see her with derricks, he would be disgusted by sayuri's behavior and she would have to accept nobu as her danna. ""a few days later, after returning to gion, sayuri receives a call to go to the teahouse. sayuri expects to see nobu, but instead the chairman comes and finally reveals to her that he has known all along that she was the girl at the riverbank. he tells her that he had told nobu about the affair after confronting pumpkin for her behavior, effectively destroying nobu's affections for sayuri and his desire to be her danna. he also reveals that he was responsible for sending mameha to her so that she could fulfill her dreams of becoming a geisha. sayuri finally reveals her love to the chairman, and the film ends with their loving embrace and kiss, and a stroll through the garden.""",dramatic

615,The Shrine,"""the film starts with a man tied to a table. another man then kills him with a sledgehammer to the face."" a journalist, carmen, is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, marcus who is a photographer. carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him. carmen asks dale, her boss, to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional polish village of alvania, including the man killed at the beginning of the film, who was named eric. she also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of central europe. dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time, and he does not give her permission to go. instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer's bees go missing. carmen and her intern sara visit eric's mother, laura. laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the polish and the american police. however, they are unwilling or too busy to help her. carmen asks laura if eric's luggage has been returned to her. laura says that it has and carmen borrows eric's journal. ""later in her home while reading eric's journal, she has a dream of eric with bloody eyes who tells her """"""""leave me alone"""""""". carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and sara to alvania. upon reaching alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in eric's journal. although english is taught in the villages' school, not all the villagers know how (or are willing) to speak it."" they see a man named henryk butchering a pig, then find a girl named lidia picking flowers and approach her. they show her a picture of eric and ask if she has seen him. the girl reacts at the sight of eric in the picture but is hesitant to answer. before she even can, henryk calls to her and sends her off. carmen, sara and marcus explore the village. they notice that the villagers treat their religious leaders like royalty. they then spot a strange dense area of fog which seems to be concentrated only in one portion of the forest, also mentioned in eric's notes. when they attempt to investigate the fog they are threatened by henryk and the villagers and told to leave. leaving the village initially, carmen tells marcus that they should go back and investigate the fog. marcus initially disagrees and insists that they leave. carmen manages to convince marcus to return by admitting that her editor knows nothing about the trip and that her career will be over if she returns with no story. they leave their car and walk into the forest, where they eventually find the area with the fog. carmen, sara and marcus find it strange that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense, therefore preventing marcus from taking pictures of anything inside it. sara enters the fog and disappears into it. carmen and marcus wait for sara to return but after a while, they lose their patience. marcus insists that they leave but they can't leave sara behind. carmen enters the fog to find her. moments after carmen enters the fog, sara somehow gets out and is found by marcus. sara appears scared and unfocused. carmen seems to have gotten lost in the fog and comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. carmen takes a picture of it, and moves to the side of the statue in order to take another picture. looking up from the camera she sees that the statue has turned its head to face carmen. the statue's eyes bleed and the 'heart' in its hand starts to beat. this frightens carmen. as she backs away from the statue, she finds herself out of the fog and is found by marcus and sara. sara and carmen talk about seeing the statue, both a bit disoriented, also having heard strange whispering voices. as they make their way back to their car, they come across lidia, who claims to know the whereabouts of eric and takes them to a hidden sacrificial shrine, where they discover the bodies of people (including eric) that the village people have executed. each body has a metal mask deeply embedded in its face, making it look as though the villagers are cultists and are practicing some kind of ritual black magic on the tourists who come to alvania. marcus, sara and carmen notice that lidia is gone and find the door of the shrine barred. luckily, marcus is able to open it, but they are suddenly surrounded by the villagers and flee, hiding in a nearby barn. they are found and struggle to escape, but one of the villagers knocks carmen out. henryk shoots sara's leg with a crossbow. the villagers knock her out with chloroform but not before she sees the face of one of the villagers turn into a demon. marcus runs into the forest and is chased by henryk, who catches up with him. marcus fights henryk but the latter gains the upper hand and knocks him out with chloroform. as they wake up, they see henryk talking to lidia. lidia walks off and the villagers bring them back to the entrance of the sacrificial shrine where the head of the village's church, arkadiusz, decides to sacrifice both sara and carmen. the two are taken inside the shrine while marcus is led away by two villagers and is forced at gunpoint to dig a grave. after one of them leaves, marcus uses the shovel to disarm the remaining villager with the gun and knock him unconscious. he takes the gun and runs off to rescue sara and carmen. at the shrine, cultists strip carmen and sara and dress them in ceremonial gowns. the cultists place sara on the same ceremonial table where eric was killed while carmen is placed in a prison cell. the cultists secure sara's arms, legs and head. they then deeply lacerate her arms and sever her achilles' tendons. while this is being done to her, she sees the faces of the cultists and arkadiusz turn into demons. the same mask earlier found on the corpses is placed over sara's head. it has two spikes inside of it which are meant to pierce sara's eyes. arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask into sara's face, killing her. one of the cultists looks at carmen and she sees that the cultist's face has become that of a demon. they bring her out to be sacrificed but marcus rescues her. he locks the cultists in the shrine and he and carmen make their escape. they enter a villager's house to steal the keys to a truck. marcus sees a woman, emilia, and her son, dariusz, in the kitchen. the woman calls for her husband, aleks, but is unable to do anything since marcus still has the gun. marcus asks them for the keys to the truck but they can't understand english. when they see carmen, emilia expresses fear and panic. marcus takes the family to their living room and ties up the couple. while marcus tries to get them to give him the keys, carmen starts to experience voices. she sees the objects in the room shake. she sees dariusz turn into a demon. she sees emilia and aleks turn demonic, untie themselves and crawl on the floor. marcus turns to carmen and he too has become a demon. but in truth all of them are still human, emilia and aleks are still tied up and none of them are even looking at her. carmen hides in another room where she continues to see and hear things. dariusz, who understands and speaks english, leads marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. not wanting to risk dariusz going out and calling for help, marcus also ties him up. the boy begs for marcus to let them go and warns him that carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room and lets out a very loud shriek. the cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for her, hear the shriek and are alerted to carmen's location. marcus hears carmen calling out to him. as he enters the room she went inside, through a door from the kitchen, another door leading back to the living room closes. marcus hears aleks and emilia scream in fear and pain, followed by footsteps going to the kitchen. he then hears dariusz screaming. as he looks out from the door, he sees the boy being dragged away. the door then closes and dariusz's screaming stops. the door leading to the living room slowly opens. he goes to the living room and finds the entire family brutally killed. the possessed carmen then jumps on him and pins him on the floor. just as she is about to kill him, she is confronted by the cultists. she kills several of them, but arkadiusz fights back with prayers and holy water. he calls for the mask but the cultist holding the mask is stunned with fear, giving the possessed carmen the opportunity to impale arkadiusz. she turns her attention back to marcus. before arkadiusz dies, he passes on his duties to henryk. henryk chants prayers while splashing carmen with holy water, and stabs her. the prayers weaken her, allowing henryk to slowly set her on the floor. two more cultists help. they impale carmen's hands and pin her to the floor. henryk calls for the mask and this time, the cultist holding the mask complies. they position the mask over carmen's face while henryk readies the sledgehammer. however carmen still struggles and the mask can't be properly placed over her eyes. marcus now realizes what is going on and understands why it was necessary to kill sara and carmen. they had seen the statue, which is why the villagers had to kill them, but he himself hasn't. the cultists weren't sacrificing anyone; they were trying to prevent demonic possession from taking place. knowing this, marcus assists henryk and the others by holding carmen's head still. with the mask now in place, henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. carmen returns to normal and asks marcus for help but he knows it is just a trick. henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on carmen, killing her. ""marcus then looks at henryk and the remaining men, wondering what will happen to him since he knows too much. one of the villagers asks henryk what they will do with marcus. in the end, marcus is set free by the villagers. henryk offers to have one of the village's men take him to where he needs to go. marcus looks over to the forest where the fog is seen. not knowing what is really inside the fog, he asks henryk about it. he is told that the fog and the statue are a curse left long ago on the village that cannot be undone. the devilish statue is shown once more and the screen goes black.""",paranormal

she leaves new york and begins to live with jacques. she hears the story that if one truly loves the deep sea, then a mermaid will appear at the depths of the sea, and will lead a diver to an enchanted place. at the next world diving championships, enzo beats jacques' record. the depths at which the divers are competing enter new territory and the dive doctor suggests they should cease competing, but the divers decide to continue. jacques is asked to look at a local dolphinarium where a new dolphin has been placed, and where the dolphins are no longer performing; surmising that the new dolphin is homesick, the three of them break in at night to liberate the dolphin and transport her to the sea again. back at the competition, other divers attempt to break enzo’s new record but all fail. jacques then attempts his next dive and reaches 400 ft (122m) breaking enzo's world record. angered by this, enzo prepares to break jacques' new world record. the doctor supervising the dive warns that the competitors must not go deeper - based upon jacques' bodily reactions, at around 400 ft, conditions, and in particular the pressure, will become lethal and divers will be killed if they persist in attempting such depths. enzo dismisses the advice and attempts the dive anyway, but is unable to make his way back to the surface. jacques dives down to rescue him. enzo, dying, tells jacques that the doctor was right and also that it is better down there, and begs jacques to help him back down to the depths, where he belongs. jacques is grief-stricken and refuses, but after enzo dies in his arms, finally honors his dying wish and takes enzo's body back down to 400feet, leaving him to drift to the ocean floor. jacques - himself suffering from cardiac arrest after the dive - is rescued and brought back to the surface by supervising scuba divers and requires his heart to be restarted with a defibrillator before being placed in medical quarters to recover. jacques appears to be recovering from the diving accident, but later experiences a strange hallucinatory dream in which the ceiling collapses and the room fills with water, and he finds himself in the ocean depths surrounded by dolphins. johana, who has just discovered she is pregnant, returns to check up on jacques in the middle of the night, but finds him lying awake yet unresponsive in his bed with bloody ears and a bloody nose. johana attempts to help him, but jacques begins to get up and walk to the empty diving boat and gets suited up for one final dive. desperately, johana begs jacques not to go, saying she is alive but whatever has happened at the depths is not, but he says he has to. she tells jacques that she is pregnant, and sorrowfully begs him to stay, but finally understands he feels he must go. the two embrace and johana breaks down crying. jacques then places the release cord for the dive ballast in her hand, and - still sobbing - she pulls it, sending him down to the depths he loves. jacques descends and floats for a brief moment staring into the darkness. a dolphin then appears and - dreamlike - jacques lets go of his harness and swims away with it into the darkness. original and alternate (us) endings ""the original ending was intentionally ambiguous, though considering the depth jacques has swum to, it would seem he is unlikely to regain the surface alive, and he dies. in the us version the ending is extended with an additional scene. after swimming away with the dolphin, jacques is brought back to the surface.""",cult

""confrontations are typically with the brotherhood, who vie for new recruits with the x-men over the course of the season. toad is the first to be introduced, followed by avalanche, blob and quicksilver. the brotherhood, led by mystique, are in fact being directed by a higher power, the identity of whom was """"""""revealed"""""""" in the two-part season finale as being magneto. after

mutants, including beast, who becomes a teacher at the xavier institute and an x-man, as well as a version of the new mutants: boom boom, sunspot, iceman, wolfsbane, magma, multiple, jubilee, berzerker, and cannonball. during the course of the season, it is revealed that the villains who supposedly perished on asteroid m are actually alive. sabretooth continues his pursuit of wolverine, while magneto continues to work his own agenda. mystique poses as risty wilde, a high school student at bayville high who befriends rogue and breaks into the mansion to steal xavier's cerebro files. using the files, she recovers wanda maximoff, the scarlet witch, magneto's daughter and quicksilver's sister. the mentally unstable mutant joins the brotherhood upon mystique's return, allowing them to defeat the x-men in a battle at the bayville mall. before the finale, a pivotal episode aired featuring the telepath mesmero opening one of three doors that would unleash a mutant known as apocalypse. in the season finale, xavier rigorously trains his x-men to face magneto, pairing them with the brotherhood. cyclops, furious with having to work with his former adversaries, leaves the team. the mansion is later set to self-destruct with cyclops and several students still inside. magneto, meanwhile, recruits sabretooth, gambit, pyro and colossus as his acolytes to fight the x-men/brotherhood team. at the same time, wolverine is captured by bolivar trask to use as a test subject for the anti-mutant weapon, the sentinel. magneto continues to manipulate events by unleashing the sentinel onto the city, forcing the x-men to use their powers in public. wanda tracks down magneto and attacks him while he is trying to deal with the sentinel that is targeting him. the sentinel is damaged and apparently crushes magneto as it falls. when the mutants who have not been captured by the sentinel return to the remains of the mansion, cyclops and the students emerge from the explosion with minor injuries. scott throws xavier from his wheelchair and blames him for blowing up the mansion. everyone is shocked as xavier calmly stands up, transforming into mystique. season three in seasons three and four, the show notably begins to take a much more serious tone. after the battle with the sentinel, the mutants are no longer a secret and public reaction is one of hostility. the show is brought into more traditional x-men lore, dealing with themes of prejudice, public misconception, and larger threats. as the season progresses, the real xavier is found, mystique is defeated, the mansion is rebuilt, and the x-men allowed back into bayville high. scott and jean develop a stronger and closer romantic relationship (particularly after mystique kidnaps scott and brings him to mexico), spyke leaves the x-men when his mutant ability becomes uncontrollable, deciding to live with the sewer-dwelling mutants known as the morlocks, and wanda continues to search for magneto, who she discovers was saved by quicksilver at the last second, until magneto uses the telepathic mutant mastermind to change her childhood memories. as part of the series arc, rogue loses control of her powers, leading to her hospitalization. during this time, she learns that she is in fact mystique's adoptive daughter. mystique, through the visions of the mutant destiny, foresaw that the fate of rogue and herself lay in the hands of an ancient mutant that would be resurrected. apocalypse emerges in the season's final episodes. mesmero manipulates magneto into opening the second door, and uses mystique and a hypnotized rogue to open the last, turning mystique to stone in the process. now released, apocalypse easily defeats the combined strength of the x-men, magneto, the acolytes, and the brotherhood before escaping. season four ""the final season contained only nine episodes. in the season premiere, apocalypse apparently kills magneto while rogue murders mystique by pushing her petrified figure off a cliff, leaving nightcrawler without closure. the brotherhood become temporary do-gooders, wolverine's teenage girl clone x-23 returns, xavier travels to scotland in order to confront his son david, spyke and the morlocks rise to the surface, rogue is kidnapped by gambit and taken to louisiana to help free his father, and shadowcat discovers a mutant ghost who is found in an underground cave. the character leech is also introduced as a young boy named """"""""dorian leach""""""""."" in the finale, apocalypse defeats xavier and storm, transforming

beneath the nightstand that is flickering and vibrating.as he is closing up shop, garrett hears a noise near the basement. the door begins shaking, and he runs for it. garrett tries to run out of the mansion, but the doorknob has been heated. he tries to break out a window with a stool, only for the stool to be thrown back. garrett runs back toward the basement. the floor is filling up with green slime, and the stairs break apart. garrett holds on as he sees a ghost rise up from the floor.at columbia university, dr. erin gilbert (kristen wiig) is approached by ed mulgrave (ed begley, jr.), a publisher who has a book that erin wrote some years ago on the existence of ghosts. she's not proud of having written it, and she's even less than pleased to learn it has resurfaced. erin knows it was done by her former friend and colleague abby yates (melissa mccarthy). ed approaches erin because of the haunting at the aldridge mansion and asks her to look in on it. as erin looks up abby's current workplace, she learns from the university's dean harold filmore (charles dance) that she is up for tenure, so she does what she can to hide knowledge of the book.erin finds abby in her lab with her new work partner jillian holtzmann (kate mckinnon), a brilliant engineer who is also a bit nutty. erin and abby are still upset with each other over the book, and erin demands abby take the book off amazon. erin then brings up the aldridge mansion haunting, inspiring abby and holtzmann to spring into action, with erin reluctantly joining them.the three ladies arrive at the mansion with some equipment. the basement has been locked tight. erin steps on some slime. suddenly, the three notice that the basement door is now open and emitting an eerie blue glow. they are then face-to-face with the ghost of gertrude aldridge. erin approaches her calmly, but gertrude's face turns demonic and she spews ectoplasmic bile all over erin. the ghost flies out of the building. the ladies record a video with erin proclaiming that ghosts are real. unfortunately, this falls into filmore's hands, and he fires erin for being a bad representation of the school.now that erin is jobless, she decides to join abby and holtzmann in their research. abby and holtzmann also lose their job after talking to the dean (who happens to be a dick), so they steal equipment from the school's lab and decide to open up their own facility.we meet mta worker patty tolan (leslie jones). she is approached by a weird guy named rowan north (neil casey). he rambles on about a """"""""fourth cataclysm"""""""", which patty pays no mind to. she then has to go into the tunnel to check something out. behind her, rowan plants another device similar to the one at the mansion. patty then sees a ghost in a prison suit. she runs like hell away from it.erin, abby, and holtzmann set up shop in a new location above a chinese food restaurant as the """"""""department of metaphysical examination"""""""". a young man named kevin beckman (chris hemsworth) shows up for a receptionist job. erin thinks he's hot, but during the interview, kevin proves to be really dumb. still, they hire him on the spot. the ladies are then visited by patty, who mentions the ghost she spotted in the subway.patty leads the ladies to the tunnel where she spotted the ghost. holtzmann brings along some equipment she built to catch the ghost. they see the same ghost that patty saw hovering above them. they record the ghost with their hd cams while erin is given a proton laser to capture it. the laser isn't strong enough to hold the ghost down, and the train is coming in fast. the ladies run to safety as the train hits the ghost, causing them to get splattered with ectoplasm slime while the ghost is stuck on the train.the video of the ghost goes viral, and the media dubs the team """"""""ghostbusters"""""""", to their chagrin. famed de-bunker martin heiss (bill murray) goes on record to dismiss the subway ghost as fake. patty decides to join the team since she knows how to get around the city, and she provides the team with a vehicle for carrying equipment. it's a hearse that she borrowed from her uncle, which only holtzmann seems to enjoy, and it becomes the new ecto-1.hotlzmann shows off some new equipment she made to catch ghosts, including a new laser gun, a grenade, and a proton glove. it's all untested, so most of it turns out to be dangerous, but the team thinks it's all cool.the team is called to investigate a ghostly sighting at a musical theater. rowan is seen planting another device in the theater. abby's specter detector (not the actual name of the device) goes off near the dressing rooms. patty is chased by a mannequin possessed by a ghost. the ghostbusters hit the mannequin with their proton lasers, releasing a huge flying ghost monster into the theater. they follow it up to the stage where a band called beasts of mayhem are performing. the ghost flies out, making everyone think it's part of the show until the ghostbusters rush the stage and try to hit it with their lasers. abby stage-dives and goes for it, and patty follows, but nobody catches her. she gets up and has the ghost perched on her shoulders. the other three wait for patty to be still as they hit it with their lasers. holtzmann pulls out a trap and has the ghost sucked into it. everyone cheers the team on, while ozzy osbourne is backstage and thinks he's having a """"""""flashback"""""""".the team celebrates their first capture with some pizza. abby and erin discuss how they were friends since high school. erin also mentions how when she was a child, the ghost of her mean neighbor would stand at the foot of her bed every day for a year, and nobody believed her when she said it. they are then visited by martin heiss so he can prove that the team is faking their capture. erin gets annoyed and decides to prove heiss right by bringing out the trap and releasing the ghost. the ghost flies out and pushes heiss out a window as it escapes into the city.after the police arrive, the team is escorted by agents hawkins (michael kenneth williams) and rourke (matt walsh) to meet with mayor bradley (andy garcia) and his assistant jennifer lynch (cecily strong). while they are thankful for the team's capture of the ghost, they want them to say they are frauds so as to not cause a stir in the city.when the team is alerted to a new ghost sighting, erin realizes there is a pattern to all the appearances in the city. it is discovered that all the devices found are along leylines that intersect at the mercado hotel. they find a picture of the staff, and patty recognizes rowan among them, knowing he is their guy. the team heads to the hotel and finds rowan in the basement with a device he built in which he plans to release a horde of ghosts upon the city as payback for being constantly mistreated. abby tries to convince rowan to stop his plans until she mentions the police are on their way. rowan then grabs two pillars and electrocutes himself before the police arrive. the basement is then closed off, but the specter detector is left behind and goes haywire.at home, erin reads through a copy of her book that rowan was keeping to orchestrate his plan. she looks through the drawings and sees that he had always planned to electrocute himself so that he can become a ghost and eventually bring about the fourth cataclysm to lead the ghosts and terrorize the world.at headquarters, abby hears a knocking at the door, but no one is there. there is a rattling on the sink's pipe, and she sees a green glow in the drain. rowan's ghost then possesses abby. she starts breaking holtzmann's equipment and then grabs holtzmann by the throat to dangle her out a window. patty intervenes and rescues holtzmann before smacking rowan out of abby. moments later, kevin pulls up on his motorcycle, and rowan possesses him. he rides off back to the hotel.erin runs to a restaurant where she finds mayor bradley and lynch eating. she frantically tries to warn them to evacuate the city, but she comes off as crazy, so she is taken away.rowan in kevin's body makes it to the hotel basement and attacks the two guards standing outside. he manages to break the barriers keeping the ghosts trapped to allow them to fly free, beginning the ghost invasion upon the city. a portal opens in the sky, releasing more and more ghosts upon the city. erin tries to get a cab, but the cabbie (dan aykroyd) dismisses her and drives off.abby, holtzmann, and patty gear up and head off the fight ghosts. they run into none other than slimer (adam ray) the green ghost eating from a hot dog cart. he steals the ecto-1 and drives off. abby and patty get ready to shoot at the car, but holtzmann says the equipment on top of the car is basically a nuke. they then spot a bunch of ghosts that look like giant parade floats, which they start popping with their proton packs. a float in the shape of the stay-puft marshmallow man shows up and presses down on the three, rendering them immobile. erin saves them by popping stay-puft with a swiss army knife that holtzmann gave her. the team then faces off against dozens of ghosts, including gertrude, the subway ghost, and the theater ghost.the ghostbusters head to the hotel to find a still-possessed kevin having frozen the police and military. rowan leaves kevin's body and decides to take on a familiar, more """"""""friendly"""""""" form - the ghostbusters logo. however, he grows into a humongous beast that bursts out of the hotel and begins wreaking havoc on the city. as they see slimer and other ghosts riding down the street, the team gets the idea to hit the ecto-1's nuclear reactor into the portal to reverse it and eventually close it. they fire their lasers at the ghosts to have them steer into the portal before hitting the reactor. the plan works, and the ghosts start getting pulled back into the portal. rowan holds on to two buildings, so the team hits him in the groin with their lasers to loosen his grip. he starts to get sucked in, but he grabs abby and pulls her into the portal. erin hooks herself up to a wire and jumps into the portal. she fires her laser at rowan's hand to release abby while he is pulled into the abyss. holtzmann and patty pull the two out, and they return with totally beached white hair.afterward, mayor bradley continues to deny the ghost problem, but he secretly gives the team funding to continue their work. they upgrade their headquarters to a firehouse (same as the original movie). patty's uncle bill (ernie hudson) then pulls in with a new hearse. he's not happy about what happened to the other one.during the credits, we see the team being visited by holtzmann's mentor rebecca gorin (sigourney weaver), who inspired her to be crazy. patty then calls the team to the roof. the city's buildings are lit up to say """"""""i love gb"""""""". there is also a dedication to harold ramis.after the credits, the team is doing some work while patty is listening to a recording. erin walks over to see what's up. patty simply asks, """"""""what's zuul?""""""""""",paranormal

mob is looking for him. he is attacked by a german shepard, but the dog gets the worst of the encounter. the posse gives up for the night, but donovan reports they did find a dead dog, so he must be in the woods somewhere.the next morning tony awakes under a bush, but he has transformed back into human form. he heads out of the woods and into town. he spots a telephone booth at a gas station and

""""""""where is forbin?"""""""" it demands. so cleo confesses the truth.colossus and guardian engage in more dialog, while colossus tells the humans to have forbin on the line at 0800 the next morning """"""""or action will be taken."""""""" also: guardian dictates an ultimatum to the soviet authorities: kill kuprin or a missile will take out moscow.once forbin returns to the command center, colossus orders him to arrange for """"""""visual and audio surveillance"""""""" to cover him at all times--or the colossus-guardian team will nuke washington. forbin reluctantly agrees--but has one last meeting before the deadline. at this meeting he proposes three things:1. the technicians will write a program powerful enough to overload colossus' circuits.2. the air force will painstakingly seek to disable all the missiles.3. cleo markham will pretend to be forbin's mistress, and if forbin can convince colossus to let them have a little privacy in their lovemaking, forbin can get information in and out, with cleo as the channel.the next day, forbin goes under surveillance, as agreed. in a dialog fraught with irony, forbin gets colossus to agree to let him and cleo have private moments--under several almost humiliating conditions. among them: that forbin work with his technicians to give colossus a proper voice, so that colossus can communicate by more means than through slow terminals and teletypes.cleo markham succeeds in playing the part of a lover. forbin keeps the relationship coldly professional as soon as the cameras and mikes are off--the first night. the second night, cleo asks forbin to make it somewhat more than professional. it becomes clear that cleo has been in love with forbin the whole time, though she knew him to be a cold fish, and is now availing herself of the opportunity to thaw him out.the overload program ends in worse than failure: colossus correctly identifies johnson and fisher as the authors of the overload program and orders the guards to shoot them down--right outside forbin's window, where they will lie where they fell overnight and until the next morning, when the guard will then cremate them. that night is another night for cleo to visit forbin, and forbin breaks confinement to drink at night--which colossus criticizes him for.the missile-crippling program, however, has another stroke of luck. when colossus tries out its new voice (paul frees), it announces that colossus and guardian are now one corporate entity. then it calls for manual realignment of all missiles to new targets--the capital cities of nation-states not under the direct control of either constituent mainframe. grauber sees the point at once: in a few weeks they can reservice every missile--and place dummy guidance modules that will render them useless.but colossus has the last laugh. one day, it is confidently sending out blueprints for a third system, that it expects forbin to build for it on crete, after evacuating its entire population. the next day, it addresses the world--and after boasting that it is now the ruler of the world, it says it has known about the sabotage since its inception, and will now detonate two missiles, one in death valley and one in the ukraine, that were still active.the detonation kills grauber, the secstate, and the secdef.forbin, crushed by what he has seen, takes a desktop telephone, jerks out its cable, and throws it into a monitor. colossus takes no notice and goes on with its message that """"""""time and events"""""""" will vindicate it. forbin reacts in the most emotion he has ever displayed in his life: """"""""you [illegitimate son]!"""""""" he shouts. and when paparazzi start snapping pictures at him, he roars at them to """"""""get out!"""""""" but cleo markham reaches for his hand, and smiles warmly.the last word colossus has for forbin is that colossus will release forbin from surveillance the next day, and expects forbin to work with it, even if reluctantly at first. forbin insists he will never do this, perhaps knowing that his protests are as futile as are those of a petulant child under parental or school discipline.""",cult

""with the radio open, the president attempts to persuade grady that there is no war. grady's son also attempts to convince him. under standing orders that such a late recall attempt must be a soviet trick, grady ignores them. grady tells his crew that """"""""we're not just walking wounded, we're walking dead men,"""""""" due to radiation from the soviet missiles. he intends to fly the aircraft over moscow and detonate the bombs in the plane. his co-pilot notes, """"""""there's nothing to go home to."""""""" meanwhile, the american president has ordered another american bomber to circle over new york city with 40-megaton payload, which should be dropped in case of the bombing of moscow. the american ambassador in moscow reports about the final moments of the russian capital before being vaporized from the blast.""

inside the truck stop debates on what to do next when all of the 18-wheeler semi trucks at the truck stop start up and begin to drive in a circle around the truck stop building, trapping the people inside.back on the deserted highway, curtis and connie spot a long convoy of driverless trucks traveling on the opposite end of the road when one of the trucks, an older model flatbed, notices them and begins to chase them. curtis is able to maneuver away from the truck and cause it to crash off an embankment, destroying it. he sees the sign for the dixie boy and takes the exit.upon arrival, curtis and connie see the truck stop under siege by the circling trucks and when curtis attempts to drive through the circle to reach the safety of the inside, their car is hit and gets toppled over by one of the trucks. bill and brett run outside and rescue curtis and connie and as they run back, hendershot walks out with a m-72 66mm law (light anti-tank) rocket launcher and blows up two of the trucks with anti-tank rockets, saving them.a little later, bill asks joe about the weapons hendershot has in the basement. bill and brett venture to the cellar and discover a huge stash of weapons ranging from assault rifles to rocket launchers to grenades. hendershot appears and threatens to send bill back to prison for snooping around, but bill arms himself and warns hendershot not to interfere with him. bill confides in brett about his criminal past about robbing a grocery store and his predicament and that hendershot does not seem to take anything seriously.at nightfall, the power in the truck stop goes out as the trucks continue circling the building. brett notices a bright green light covering the sky and deducts that the passing comet is responsible. bill suggests traveling to an island where there are no vehicles or machines and hide out until it is all over.a little later, when everyone hears the sounds of the injured camp loman screaming from the ditch where he landed earlier, bill and curtis volunteer to go out to rescue him. carrying weapons borrowed from hendershot's arsenal as well as rope, they run to a nearby building past the trucks (many of which are starting to run out of fuel) and lower themselves into a nearby sewer drainpipe to lead to the ditch where loman is.in the meantime, deke has made it to the dixie boy and crawls through another drainpipe to the creek where loman is, but the wounded and near-death bible salesman, by this time has become insane and tries to kill deke when he approaches him. bill and curtis come by and grab deke away as a dump truck spots them and attempts to run them down, forcing them leave behind loman (whom is presumably dead by this point) and back into the drainpipe. they make it back to the showers building and run across the parking lot back to the dixie boy, with bill blowing up another truck with his rocket launcher. bill at first refuses to tell deke where his father is until hendershot blurts out that duncan was killed earlier by one of the trucks. deke is devastated, while everyone (brett most of all) is angry at hendershot for being so insensitive. hendershot remains oblivious to his own actions.the next morning, most of the trucks have stalled, having run out of gas. however, two more trucks arrive, they are a large bulldozer and a small military vehicle with a m-60 machine gun mounted. when the bulldozer crashes into the building, hendershot (despite the protests from bill) fires a rocket at it, temporarily disabling it. as a result, the military vehicle opens fire on the dixie boy building. in the storm of bullets, hendershot, wanda june, and three of the truck drivers are fatally gunned down. then the military vehicle begins beeping its horn in a morse code message which deke translates as """"""""someone must pump fuel. someone will not be harmed. all fuel must be pumped.""""""""when the power for the building comes on again, bill decides to turn on the pumps, despite brett's protests not to trust the trucks. bill points out that they have to with the military vehicle's presence. over most of the day, in 100f degree heat, bill, brett, deke, curtis, and a few others take turns venturing outside and refueling all the trucks, plus hundreds more trucks that arrive at the dixie boy to refuel. when the fuel runs out, a driverless tanker truck appears and beckons bill to refill the truck stop's fuel tanks to continue the refueling.exhausted by the hard work and the heat, bill retires to rest where brett comforts him. bill points out a possible explanation for these events as being a race of aliens using the comet to wipe out humanity and having the machines making them work as their slaves.handy tells bill about working on an escape where they will get out through the basement and to a drainage pipe to the outside. sometime later, bill walks outside where he talks to another truck driver filling up the trucks where he drops a grenade into the small military vehicle, destroying it. with that, all of the refueled trucks begin circling the dixie boy once again.at nightfall, bill, brett, deke, curtis, connie and the rest of the survivors escape through the drainage pipe, armed with various weapons from the late hendershot's arsenal and decide to make a run for the open ocean and to the island where there are no trucks. when the trucks see that the people inside the dixie boy are gone, they all smash into the building, destroying it in a series of spectacular explosions.bill leads the survivors across the back roads and fields in the area to make it to the local marina to find a sailboat to take them to the island. they have narrow encounters with numerous machines including the driverless ice cream truck. upon arrival at the marina, they all head out to a sailboat when one of the truck drivers, named brad, attempts to steal a diamond ring from the corpse of a woman caught in her car passenger window when the leader of the living trucks, the green goblin of happy toyz, arrives and runs down brad, killing him. bill runs from the docks and quickly destroys the happy toyz truck with a rocket launcher.in the final shot, bill, brett and the rest of the dozen survivors sail away from the marina to find help and safety. a disclaimer in the final shot reveals that two days later a russian """"""""weather satelite"""""""" destroyed a large ufo orbiting earth with nuclear tipped missiles, causing all machines to become sedate. another two days later, earth passed through the tail of the comet and everything seemingly returned to normal. it is also implied that the dixie boy survivors were the only survivors to the worldwide machine revolt.""",cult

1322,Diggstown,"""gabriel caine (james woods), a con man, is released from prison in winfield, georgia and immediately gets to work on his next scam. caine and his partner, fitz (oliver platt), travel to a small town not far from the prison: diggstown, a city obsessed with boxing."" a mean-spirited man named john gillon (bruce dern) owns almost all of diggstown. he is feared by many but also respected because he was the former manager of diggstown’s pride and joy, the once-famous boxer charles macom diggs, the man for whom the town is named. upon hearing a remark that diggs once knocked out five fighters in one day, fitz “drunkenly” says he knows of a fighter who could knock out any 10 in one day: honey roy palmer. gillon tries to take advantage of the situation and bets fitz $100,000 that no one man can best ten diggstown boxers in one day. caine quickly volunteers to finance fitz's bet and the con is on. caine seeks out an old buddy, palmer (louis gossett jr.), who is now a 48-year-old ymca supervisor. after some initial reluctance, palmer agrees to participate and starts to train for the fight. caine and gillon agree to various conditions of the bet, with “one day” being 24 full hours and “diggstown fighters” being able to come from any surrounding area of olivair county. a loan shark backs caine's bet, with the understanding that his health and welfare will be riding on the outcome. caine discovers that gillon’s treachery (and his bank account) goes deeper than diggstown people know. as his manager, gillon drugged diggs during a fight so that gillon could collect on the opponent’s long odds. diggs suffered irreversible brain damage as a result. with help from his prison buddy wolf's sister (heather graham), it is learned that gillon has more than $1.5 million in assets. caine tricks him into risking all of it. now it is up to honey roy palmer to defeat all 10 of diggstown's men. they begin with: buck holland, who is played by former heavyweight boxing contender rocky pepeli who puts up a good fight, palmer barely beats him. slim busby, who like his brother, hambone, has been bribed by caine to take a dive. billy hargrove (a young james caviezel), who is easily beat. sam lester (played by roger hewlett), who is secretly given a laxative before the fight and eventually runs from the ring. hambone busby, who, like his brother, has been bribed to take a dive. gillon, however, threatens to kill hambone’s brother, slim, unless he is victorious in the ring. hambone fights a vicious fight, but is ultimately defeated. slim is indeed found murdered. palmer is enraged. his next fight is with sonny hawkins, who is easily dispatched. robby gillon, the son of john gillon, approaches the ring next, but then backs out under instructions from his father. his cowardice is regarded as a forfeit. frank mangrum officially loses to disqualification after kicking palmer in the groin, then hitting the referee then gets knocked out by palmer. tank miller, a gargantuan fighter, is next. he puts up a good fight, but a tiring palmer eventually beats him. that brings up diggstown's best man, hammerhead hagan, the only fighter ever to actually beat palmer during their professional careers. he is brought in as a surprise ringer. gillon moved him in as a county resident just before the bet rules were established, meaning that hagan can legally fight. the bout is one-sided. palmer looks done for, but he gets new motivation after seeing diggs, who is sitting courtside, move his hand slightly (which he interprets as a show of support). caine, not wanting to see his friend die, attempts to throw in the towel, but palmer catches it and throws it back. palmer rallies to knock out his opponent. ""palmer, caine and fitz begin their celebration of this miraculous feat. they are cut short by gillon, who notes that his son never entered the ring -– therefore, only nine fights have transpired. the true tenth fighter is then introduced: minoso torres, a tough-as-nails boxer who ruled the boxing underground in the prison from which caine was recently released. no one has ever defeated him. gillon admonishes caine with: """"""""never try to hustle a hustler."""""""""" an exhausted palmer is no match for torres. but just when all looks lost, caine whistles at torres, gets his attention, straightens his tie and does a thumbs-down gesture (copying a move gillon did earlier). torres drops his gloves and invites palmer to hit him, hitting the canvas, knocked out. caine was expecting such a trick from gillon and bribed torres long ago for a moment like this. ""gillon has lost everything, leading caine to correct him with an admonishment: """"""""actually, i believe it goes: never con a con-man, especially one who's better than you are."""""""" calm at first, he snaps and pulls a gun. his son, robby, tries to intervene and gillon smacks him. palmer then grabs gillon and prepares to deck him. instead, he turns to hambone, claiming, """"""""my hands hurt."""""""" hambone gladly obliges and delivers gillon a powerful knockout blow.""

previously unexplored tomb. but his assistant is not so lucky as he falls from a false floor bottom to his death on spikes in a boody-trapped chamber.upon arrival back in new york, george is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother tommy (giovanni frezza), who stayed behind in new york with the family's au-pair jamie lee (cinzia de ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. emily soon discovers that both of her children are appearing and disappearing out of their rooms every day and night. both susie and tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. a few days later, george's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called wiler, wiler guesses that it may be the sacred symbol of the grand shadow, a sight of terrible evil.over the next few days, the hacker family experiences more odd happenings. a scorpion appears in a desk drawer when george opens it. later, jamie lee is menaced by a snake that attacks her in the apartment building cellar during a game of hide-and-seek with the kids. then, emily discovers piles of sand

polaroid photo taken of susie. it shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. the woman contacts a man called adrian marcato (laurence welles) with her find. the next day, the woman

near-comatose susie, tommy is alone at the apartment when he is partly affected too. suddenly, jamie lee turns up, bursting through a wall as a briefly reanimated rotting cadaver before she drops dead. a strange blue light of negative energy is shown flowing from tommy, the bed-ridden susie, and the dimensional doorways and channeled into marcato's home where he is inciting a spell in the ancient egyptian language. george goes to see marcato again, who tells them that he can stop worrying about his children. through an ancient egyptian spell, marcato has channeled all the evil energy away from george's children and the curse is now on him. marcato gives george the amulet and tells him to discard it so the curse will not affect anyone else. that night, marcato is killed at his shop when the re-animated carcasses of his stuffed birds come to life and tear him to pieces. at the hospital, susie wakes up to see her grateful mother by her side and both are happy that susie all better. the following morning, george, following marcato's last suggestion, flings the amulet into the east river, bringing an end to their ordeal.in the final scene back in egypt, the mystical blind

piece of artwork to impress alexander, their wealthy and sinister patron, in the hopes that they will receive a large arts grant from alexander. christopher has brought along a loaf of pumpkin raisin bread, which sky starts to eat. she then reveals that she is allergic to non-organic raisins, and didn't know about them. the group asks if she'll be ok, and she agrees explaining she's only a little dizzy and needs to sit down, however she falls over and hits her head on some old machinery and dies. the group hides the body, as they are embarrassed and don't want their patron to see it when he arrives. after dumping the body in a deep freezer, macon blames christopher for sky's death and attempts to murder him before alexander arrives by pouring a jar of acid on him. the acid has no effect as it is only a jar of acetic acid (vinegar)."" the patron finally arrives to the murder party with a friend zycho (who is unknown to the group), and his dog hellhammer. alexander is also dressed as a gothic vampire, but his costume is considerably cheaper than paul's. out of jealousy, alexander forces paul to completely remove his vampire costume while zycho holds him at gunpoint. alexander reveals that zycho is his drug dealer and he was only joking with paul, telling him the gun wasn't real. each member of the murder party then gives their input on how they will commit the murder. drugs and alcohol fuel the group as they decide to wait for the witching hour, at which time they will all stab christopher in unison. while macon leaves to pick up some pizza, alexander has sex with lexi. macon arrives back to see the two having sex and this makes macon visibly upset. macon begins binge drinking hard alcohol in response and ends up covering himself in alcohol in the process. paul, a photography artist, begins taking pictures of christopher and is frustrated that no one will assist him. zycho, visibly bored with the party, asks alexander if they could leave and alexander whispers something in his ear in response. alexander then suggests that the group play a game of ultimate truth or dare. they will all take a shot of sodium pentothal (truth serum) and divulge their most inner secrets. all eventually take a shot from the same needle, except for alexander, who injects his shot into a slice of pizza. each reveals mostly trivial truths about their lives and attempt to force alexander to confirm that he indeed does have grant money to give. during this time, bill who has mostly kept to himself playing a psp and shown little visible interest in the proceedings, asks the group what they say about him behind his back. they tell him they make fun of him and plan on throwing him out of the group, but only because his work is so much better than theirs. this angers bill and he goes back to playing his psp. macon confesses his long time love for lexi and recounts a story of when they were in high school and ate a popsicle together on a water tower. macon shows he kept the leftover popsicle stick as a token but is rebuffed by lexi. alexander sends zycho out to get him some crank. macon is now extremely inebriated and goes outside to smoke a cigarette. still covered in alcohol, macon is engulfed in flames as he lights the cigarette, and only christopher notices. frustrated with not having anyone to assist in his photographs, paul calls his professional assistant to aid him. the group is not happy as the assistant is not aware of the murder party. an argument breaks out and paul injects alexander with a dose of sodium pentothal. the groups asks him about the grant again and discover alexander is actually a fraud. he is a fry cook who plans on killing the group, stealing their art, and selling it as he assumes it will be worth more. lexi discovers macon on fire and she and the assistant extinguish him. zycho returns with a bag of crank and alexander immediately tells zycho to kill everyone. paul is shot in the head but doesn't realize and seems to only be annoyed that someone interrupted his shot. the assistant is also shot in the head and zycho attacks lexi. macon, badly burned but still alive, gets his chainsaw and uses it to attack zycho, killing him and passing out shortly afterward. lexi immediately begins to untie christopher, but bill, who has now completely snapped, decides everyone has to die and kills lexi with an axe. in the excitement hellhammer eats the bag of crank and then attacks alexander. bill finishes off the wounded alexander with a baseball bat and begins hunting down the last survivor, christopher, who has now escaped. macon awakes and pursues bill with an electric chainsaw to take revenge for lexi. the chase leads them to an arts student party. chris attempts to hide in a performance art exhibit and bill is approached by the organizer and asked if has seen alexander as a grant was promised to him. bill is further enraged and vows to murder the whole scene. he enters the art exhibit and murders all the artists before cornering christopher. macon, who has arrived at the party and has found an outlet to plug in the chainsaw, falls off the roof while plugging it in. the plugged in chainsaw is conveniently left hanging in front of a window where christopher is trapped. christopher uses the chainsaw to stop bill (by killing him), and leaves the exhibit as

(it would later be revealed that nick and julie were having a secret affair.) kate is one of the rare individuals who acknowledge the existence of links instead of finding a more acceptable (albeit incorrect) explanation for the traditionally unexplained phenomena that they cause. her refusal to deny her observations jeopardizes her career as a police officer and estranges her from her fellow officers. kate's tenacity and conviction leads to her recruitment by special unit 2."" supporting characters include captain richard page (richard gant), su2's commanding officer with a prosthetic metal hand that serves as the focus of running gags. the unit's liaison with the link community is carl (danny woodburn), a verbally aggressive gnome known for kleptomania and armed robbery, who is mutually antagonistic towards nick. nick and carl's love-hate relationship contributes some of the humor within the fantasy universe of the show. carl is completely invincible to everything but a diamond-coated saw and dragon fire/teeth. other members of the unit are the technical experts, who provide background, research and technology on various links. initially the primary technician is the acerbic link biologist sean radmon (sean whalen), succeeded in season 2 by jonathan (jonathan togo), su2's obsessively enthusiastic technician who analyzes link evidence and produces a seemingly endless stream of link-related inventions with positive glee. another recurring character introduced in season 2, is alice cramer (pauley perrette), who is the unit's public relations person and acts to convince the press and witnesses that the crimes and strange events committed by links are merely toxic spills, mass hallucinations, drugged out street gangers, etc. another recurring character is jerry (mike rad), someone who drifts from job to job and occasionally encounters links. (for example, in the first episode, carl attempted to stick him up at the store he was working at.) the unit further maintains secrecy by hiding the physical location of the unit's headquarters behind the facade of a chinese laundry. the detectives drive unmarked cars and utilize sophisticated weaponry and technology to deal with link threats. ""a partial list of links encountered by su2 in the course of the episodes include a trash-talking gargoyle, the scheming pied piper posing as a children's television host, the homicidal sandman, jack the ripper and deadly snake-haired medusa, all revealed to be criminals in these particular cases. most of the monsters are portrayed as behaving rather human-like, forming urban communities.""",paranormal

355,The Beastmaster,"""the gates to the city of aruk are raised, and maax (rip torn), high priest of the city's patron god, ar, rides in with two underling priests. he goes to the central ziggurat that serves as the city's temple, and meets with three witch-women in its interior. the witches appear as shapely women with hideously disfigured faces. the witches tell maax that he is doomed by a prophecy""; he will die at the hands of the son of king zed (rod loomis). zed's wife is still pregnant with the child, and the prince will grow into a man that will kill maax. the high priest defies the prophecy and announces that the unborn son will die. maax sees ar as a bloodthirsty god who demands the life of aruk's children in sacrifice, and offering the king's son will prevent the prophecy from coming true.at that moment, king zed storms into the temple with seth (john amos), the captain of the guard, and three other city guards who have swords ready. zed has heard that maax intends to offer innocent children in sacrifice to ar, and he announces he won't allow it. zed declares that maax is to be banished from aruk to dwell in the outlands among the barbarian juns. when maax boldly declares that zed's own son must be cut from his mother, branded with the sign of ar and sacrificed, seth advances on maax, sword at the ready, and king zed warns maax that he could have him executed for such talk. maax looks over both shoulders at his underling priests, who hang themselves. zed looks on this with only scorn and contempt, and orders maax removed from the city. maax is put on a horse and escorted out, passing by an old woman with a cow.this old woman is one of maax's witch-women in disguise. at night, as zed and his wife (vanna bonta) sleep, the witch creeps into their bedchamber. she pours a foul liquid across their throats, paralyzing them and rendering them mute. zed and his wife awaken to find the witch focusing on the wife's pregnant abdomen, waving her hands over it. zed's wife convulses in silent agony as the unborn baby is transferred out of her womb into the cow. zed can only watch as his beloved wife dies from the violation, and the witch, with a dark cackle, tells him that his unborn son belongs to her, before vanishing.the witch takes the cow out into the fields, and cuts it open, extracting the baby. but as she brands the baby with the symbol of ar, the dark ritual is seen by a passing traveler who is armed with a sword and a throwing weapon called a kapa. despite the witch's dark powers, the traveler is able to slay her and rescue the baby. he brings the baby back to his home village of emir to raise as his own son.the boy is named dar, and grows into an energetic youth. his father raises and teaches him well. one day, when dar is a youth, he and his father are practicing swordplay. his father demonstrates how to throw the kapa, and, as a prank, uses it to pluck off the headwrap of a villager named tiis. the kapa lodges in a tree that tiis is near, and dar and his father laugh. but dar stops laughing as he sees a rustle in the tree line, and then urgently tells his father to run. as tiis tries to retrieve his headwrap, something concealed by the tree line yanks him out of view, and there are sounds of growling before tiis is hurled back out. a huge bear has grabbed tiis and mauled him to death, and it emerges from the tree line toward dar and his father. dar's father loses his balance and twists his ankle. he yells at dar to run and save himself. but dar slowly walks toward the bear, continuing to stare at it. dar's father watches in wonder as the bear quietly sinks back down to all fours and turns, walking away. they can do nothing for tiis, but dar's father sees that his adopted son has very curious powers neither of them understand; he can touch the mind of a beast. he holds dar's hand, where the brand is still visible, and tells him that the gods have put their mark on him, and it will be his guide until he finds out why.more years pass, and dar is a tall, handsome, strapping man (now played by marc singer). dar takes his dog, todo, and goes out with a number of other young village men to work in a field outside the village.as the men work, dar picks up a stick and smiles at todo. he throws the stick for todo to fetch. but on reaching the stick, todo doesn't return. he stands his ground and begins to bark. at first, dar just smiles at his pet and companion, but as todo continues barking, dar and the other villagers realize the dog is aware of danger. they all run up to where the dog stands. far in the distance, a great cloud of dust and the rumbling sound of galloping horses, approach emir; a band of marauding jun barbarians.dar's father and a few other village elders draw their swords and stand at the village perimeter as the jun horde approaches, but they are quickly overrun by the mounted barbarians. by the time dar and the village men arrive, the barbarians are attacking everyone and setting the village on fire. the terrified villagers all fight with desperation. dar manages to grab up a sword and, picking out the jun leader (tony epper), charges toward him. another jun barbarian comes riding up behind dar and clubs him from behind with a flail, knocking him unconscious. the juns proceed to slaughter all of the villages, women and children included, and even todo, as he tries to drag dar to safety, is hit by a crossbow bolt loosed by one of the juns. as the juns finish their work, maax rides up to the village with a number of priests and flashes a terrible smile. looking pleased, he fails to notice dar laying on the ground just a few feet in front of his horse; the brand of ar on his palm. todo grabs dar by his clothing again and resumes pulling him away.dar slowly awakens, becoming aware of the land rushing past him as if he were a great avian in flight. he blinks, and hie eyesight refocuses and returns. he sits up and sees todo lying near him, a crossbow bolt protruding from his side. todo had managed to drag him to safety before collaping and dying from his wound. dar walks in a daze among the ruins of his village; the corpses of many of the villagers have been impaled on the village's wooden beams. perched on one of the perimeter beams is a great brown eagle. dar locks eyes with the raptor, the two looking close at each other for a couple of moments.dar discards his upper garment and pulls a leather gauntlet over his hand to hide the brand. he arranges all the slain villagers in a circular formation, laying todo across the body of dar's father, with the father's arm placed around todo's neck. dar burns the bodies and takes his father's sword and throwing kapa. he remembers his father's words about the mark on his hand being his guide, and that if anything happened to the father, dar should look for their enemies, the juns, and seek his destiny in the valley of aruk.as dar begins walking away from the ruins of emir, he passes by the eagle again. once more they lock eyes, and dar forges a bond with the eagle, and it begins to follow him as a companion. (note: though dar never speaks a name for the eagle, we learn in the two beastmaster sequels that the eagle was named sherak, so that name will be used in this synopsis for the sake of uniformity).dar runs through a shallow stream toward his clothing after having bathed. as he is dressing, two ferrets come creeping through the brush. dar turns in surprise as the ferrets grab hold of his leather skirt and begin running off with it. dar chases them, losing sight of them in the brush, and takes a wrong turn, tumbling from a cliff and landing in quicksand. the ferrets, curious, crawl along an overhanging branch of a tree. dar cannot reach the branch himself, and tells the ferrets that since they got him into the situation, they need to help get him out. the little animals, of course, don't understand spoken human speech, but dar is no ordinary human. he looks up intently at the ferrets, concentrating. one of the ferrets crawls further along the branch, weighing it down, as the other begins gnawing on it. the branch tips down enough for dar to grab it and pull himself to safety. the ferret who had crawled along the branch, slips off into the quicksand, but dar is able to pluck it out and rescue it. dar names the ferrets kodo and podo, his newest friends.dar continues walking as kodo and podo ride in his belt pouch. he pauses along a cliff to rest, sherak landing near him. dar starts looking around, concerned. he hears the growling of a great feline and sees several mounted juns chasing a beast, through the eyes of the beast. he sees one of the juns snare the beast with a heavy rope lasso, and then sees one end of the lasso tied around a heavy wooden stake driven into the ground. running to investigate, he sees the juns tormenting a great black tiger they've captured. taking kodo and podo from his pouch, dar tells them that the tiger should be rescued.before dar can throw his kapa, one of the juns ambushes him from behind, but dar his fast enough to grab the jun's arm and throw him over his shoulder. they both tumble down the hillside to the ground where another jun readies his crossbow. dar throws his kapa, and the jun ducks before again aiming his crossbow, but the kapa circles around like a boomerang, hitting the jun square in the back. as another jun rides up, crossbow at the ready, dar gives a high pitched squawking sound toward sherak and grabs the one he's grappling with, using him as a human shield against the crossbow bolt. sherak then swoops down on the mounted jun, clawing at his eyes through the eyeholes in his leather hood, causing him to tumble from his horse. the two wranglers run for their weapons, but kodo and podo dart forward, snatching the bolts out of their crossbows. the wranglers grab their swords and run at dar, who kicks one away and slays the second. dar then grabs his kapa and hurls it, cutting through the rope lasso and freeing the tiger, who shows the last wrangler what it's like to face him on even terms. as dar collects his belongings, he pauses, looking at sherak and the two ferrets, who are his eyes and cunning; and now having befriended the tiger, he has great strength as well. he names the tiger ruh and sets out again.dar happens across two beautiful young women, one blonde and one brunette, swimming by a waterfall. he's intrigued and is moved to some mischief in order to introduce himself. he sends kodo and podo to snatch an outer garment by the riverbank. the brunette (tanya roberts) runs in pursuit, but quickly loses sight of them. suddenly ruh comes into view and stands in front of the girl, growling. as she stares at the tiger in fear, dar grabs her from behind, telling her that they might escape if they show no fear. he then uses his mental link to ruh to tell him to stand down and move out of sight.dar tells kiri she owes him her life, but he'll accept 'this as payment,' and then kisses her. the girl trips dar to the ground and kneels astride him, demanding to know who he is. dar tells her his name, and that his village of emir was destroyed by the juns, and he's following. the girl thinks this is funny, as dar is alone. dar manages to roll over on top of her and asks, in turn, who she is. the girl's necklace slips from her neck as dar rolls over. she tells him that her name is kiri, and she's a slave to the temple of ar's priests. dar is horrified to find whip marks across her back and shoulders, under her garment, but she reminds him again, that she's a slave. she can't run away because the priests will kill her family. she tells dar that he should continue following the juns, because they will at least grant him a death more befitting a strong man, than the priests of ar would.retrieving kiri's dropped necklace, dar decides to follow her, but he's given her too much of a head start. as he looks around, trying to pick up her trail, he catches an ominous sight: a great, dark tree on a high cliff, with several cocoon-like objects hanging from it.investigating, dar finds the cocoon-like objects to seemingly be alive. also hanging from the tree is a cage with a man in it, and before the base of the tree is a bird-like carving and a cauldron filled with a foul liquid. when a human head suddenly floats to the top of the cauldron, dar turns away with disgust, and finds himself looking at several humanoids with only eyes, but no noses, mouths, or ears on their heads, and great bat-like wings wrapped around themselves.dar draws his sword and breaks open the cage, freeing the prisoner, who tries to flee. one of the bat-bird-men unfolds its wings and envelops the prisoner. the man gives horrible muffled screams as a foul liquid pools at the creature's feet. the creature unfolds and opens its wings, and the prisoner's bones, stripped clean of all organic matter, tumble to the ground. silently the bat-bird-men advance on dar and ruh, as dar holds his sword at the ready. but as sherak descends and lands on dar's outstretched wrist, the bird-creatures retreat quickly. they revere birds as gods, and to see an eagle having befriended dar means he is protected by their gods. still wary, dar starts to leave. one of the bird-creatures gives dar a medallion with a bird symbol on it.morning comes, and dar awakens from sleep. sherak lands nearby with a squawk. dar understands the eagle sees something, and goes to look; he's arrived at the city of aruk.the road into aruk is lined with wooden poles from which hang dessicated humanoid corpses. dar looks around with a grim expression, and tells ruh to stay out of sight.the bridge is extended over the city moat, which is filled with tar instead of water. the gate is up. dar enters the city and finds the streets all but deserted. he finds a robe hung outside one of the huts and dons it. alerted to the sound of shouting, he makes his way to the great ziggurat which serves as the temple of ar.maax has usurped control of the city and keeps the people in line through fear. he performs regular child sacrifices, that ar be appeased and continue to protect the city. dar watches in disgust as maax holds aloft a baby boy, and casts it into a burning fire at the top of the ziggurat, as the townspeople bow their heads fearfully.maax announces that ar is not yet satisfied, and that another child must be sacrificed. he points, and his priests seize a baby girl as town guards restrain her parents, who scream and weep in protest. dar pushes his way to the front of the crowd until he reaches the perimeter of soldiers, who bar him from moving further. as the girl is carried to the top of the ziggurat, dar sees a number of slave girls standing along the steps of the ziggurat; kiri is among them.sherak circles the sky high above the city as maax lifts the baby girl and makes offers of sacrifice to ar. dar lowers the hood of his robe and concentrates. maax places the girl into the slope that leads down into the flames. but as the baby girl slides inexorably toward her death, sherak swoops from the skies with a majestic cry, seizes the child in its talons and flies off with her. all of the townspeople prostrate themselves on the ground in awe, except for dar. kiri starts to fall to her knees when she sees dar and looks at him in wonder.maax notices, and looks at dar intently. he doesn't recognize dar for who he is, but he does understand that he controlled the great eagle. maax watches the eagle carry the baby girl, and then looks back to where dar was standing-- but dar is no longer there. looking to save face for himself, maax points after the bird and shouts to the townspeople that ar has spoken personally to them, saying he wants their children.nighttime in aruk. dar holds a large, bulging sack, and holds kodo over it, letting the ferret sniff the sack. dar then sets kodo on the ground, and it begins to scamper from house to house, looking for more traces of the same scent.the father of the baby girl sits forlornly in his house when there's a knock at the door. his dread turns to curiosity at the sight of dar, and then to overjoy as dar produces his daughter from the sack. the father, sacco (ralph strait), pledges his gratitude and service to dar, offering him anything.dar decides to ask sacco about kiri, though he doesn't say her name; only that she is a friend. sacco asks dar into the house, saying he should at least have a meal. at the table, sacco tells dar aruk's story: most of the young men in the city were slain by the jun horde, which is how maax overthrew zed. the king is now imprisoned within the ziggurat while maax and his witchwomen sit in the seat of power. the remaining townspeople are bred by the jun priests so their children can be sacrificed by maax.dar asks sacco again about the slave girl, and sacco says they've been taken back to the temple to prepare them for their own deaths. the jun horde has gone north, but maax promises they will return. thanking sacco for the meal, dar assures him that he and his family will see dar again.maax's witchwomen have crafted a magical ring for the jun priests. maax tells them to find this man, this 'master of the beasts,' and that the ring will lead them to him.dar and ruh are tracking the slave girls when ruh finds a spring trickling from a tree. taking a drink from the tree, dar sends ruh ahead to scout. hiding in the tree is one of the jun priests. the stone in the ring is actually the closed lid of an eye. the eye opens and looks on dar, and maax and the witchwomen can see what the eye sees, in their cauldron. the eye falls on the mark on dar's hand, and maax realizes the man is zed's son. he tells the priest to kill dar immediately.the priest snares dar around the neck with a leather loop as the other priest, on horseback, approaches to kill dar. but ruh is also in the tree, above and behind the priest holding the noose. ruh ambushes the priest, taking him down and killing him. the mounted priest takes off, and ruh gives pursuit... and falls into a covered pit that the priests prepared for dar.the priest aims his crossbow to kill ruh, when he's whacked from behind by a stout wooden staff. standing there is seth, with a young boy in his late pre-teens. the priest tries to snare seth, who blocks the snare with his staff, and knocks the priest into the pit, where he is killed by ruh. seth remarks that to face a beast on its own terms, man finds he is not so strong.dar arrives, and draws his sword at the sight of seth and the boy, though he does not move to attack. hearing ruh roaring, he moves to the pit and looks, seeing seth saved ruh rather than trapped him. voicing his gratitude, dar moves to a large log, trying unsuccessfully to tip it down into the pit so ruh can use it to climb out. seth and the boy help him in this task. seth introduces himself and his companion, tal (joshua milrad) as 'pilgrims' on their way to worship at the temple of ar. understanding what seth means by worshipping, dar says he is also on his way to the temple for the same purpose. seth invites dar to travel with him and tal.over a campfire, seth tells dar how he and tal have spent three years, since fleeing aruk, trying to raise an army to fight the juns. as long as zed lives, he still remains a symbol of hope for those trying to live free of maax's tyranny. tal is zed's son, and meant to free zed from imprisonment, and one day take the throne. dar tells how he's always had an uncanny ability to communicate with animals, see through their eyes and hear their thoughts, as they can likewise do with him.dar lets tal hold kodo and podo, and empties out his pouch, explaining how they steal anything they find of value. tal picks up the jun priest's eye-ring, not knowing what it is, and dar, also unknowing, tells him he can keep it. but also among the items is kiri's necklace. they see it, and seth's demeanor turns stern as he demands to know where dar found it. despite seth's protests, dar insists it came from a slave girl, and dar is trying to rescue her before she's put to death at the temple. seth sternly says they leave at dawn, before walking away. tal and seth know kiri-- she's tal's cousin.at dawn, dar awakens from sleep and sends sherak to scout. dar crouches by a campfire, seeing all that sherak sees. tal and seth awaken and understand what dar is doing. through sherak's eyes, dar sees five women in white robes surrounded by priests in red. seth knows this means the slave girls are prepared as sacrifices. he says they must make plans in order to rescue the slave girls.seth and dar hijack a barge that the priests must use to cross a great lake. when one of the priests knocks kiri down after she stumbles, and she kicks him in the groin, the priest grabs her head and pushes it under the water. dar and seth ambush the priests, capturing them and rescuing the slave girls. as they begin to depart, more priests arrive, firing crossbows, and seth realizes the barge is now too heavy to get away. kiri kicks the prisoner priests overboard and they escape. with a little 'coaxing' from kiri, dar agrees to help free zed. as they begin traveling over land back toward aruk, seth sets out to find and rally as many people as he can find, to overthrow maax and free aruk. dar, tal and kiri are to meet him in the taran valley in two nights.night time over aruk; sacco steps outside his hut and sees sherak perched nearby. sacco frets and mutters to himself, protesting that he's a coward. but he knows and still respects his vow to dar, and rides out in his wagon to smuggle dar, tal and kiri past the guards, into the city. but the eye-ring on tal's hand reveals their presence to maax, who decides to prepare a welcome.sacco tells dar and kiri that he'll wait for them on the ziggurat's north side. tal, ruh, and the ferrets go with dar and kiri into the temple. as ruh scouts ahead, dar leads the way through a corridor that looks like a potential trap; along both sides of the wall near the floor, are grated openings into some kind of prison chambers. dar thinks he sees the glowing of bestial eyes from through the grates. suddenly, with guttural bestial growls, numerous appendages-- or perhaps humanoid limbs-- encased in leather and wicked steel spikes, thrust through the grates, swiping madly at dar. seizing a chain that runs the length of the corridor from the ceiling, dar manages to cross to the other side, safely out of reach. on the other side is a lever that, when pulled, shuts the grated openings so that kiri and tal can cross through as well. tal tells dar that those were death guards, a monstrosity created by maax's priests, which explains why there were no soldiers or other guards out front.pressing forward, they find a grate in the floor of one corridor; kiri says that the chamber below has the keys to the dungeon cells. in the chamber, jun priests are in the process of preparing another death guard. tal explains how a human man is made into a mindless monster through torture. first, the priests encase his limbs in spiked leather sheaths; spikes capable of ripping a man to pieces. then a foul green liquid and green leeches are put into his ear canal to severely damage his brain. finally his head is placed into a hardened leather hood with a frightening visage on the front. stripped of all thought and reason, a death guard will mindlessly kill anything it sees; anything that moves.as tal explains the procedure, kiri quietly goes into a side corridor and turns a wall torch. a portion of the wall opens up into a chamber looking like a hidden armory.tal sees where the cell keys are; dar says that stealing is best left to thieves. he places kodo and podo in a loop of string, and lowers them carefully through the grate down to steal the keys. but just as the ferrets reach the keys, one priest happens to turn, and sees them.but that's the least of the problems; the death guard awakens, bursts its restraints and slaughters the priests. its spikes snap the string, causing kodo and podo to drop to the floor of the cell. they are able to grab the keys and run into an air vent beside the door, but the death guard breaks the door down and madly pursues the little beasts.despite dar's clear concern, he assures tal that kodo and podo are fast and cunning, and can handle themselves. they need to proceed with the rescue.kiri emerges from the armory, now wearing leather boots and a leather girdle with a dagger tucked into it. tal explains to dar what kiri truly is; a trov warrior, an ancient sect of protectors for aruk. the ziggurat used to be their home. kiri is a skilled tracker, and can find the cell where zed is imprisoned.arriving at the cell, they find it unlocked. as kiri and tal enter the cell, dar turns; he senses that ruh has caught up to them, but hasn't come into sight yet. he cautiously starts toward an intersection... nearly walking into an ambush; when in fact it is the ambushing priest that is about to get ambushed, by ruh, who kills him. satisfied, dar hurries back to the cell where kiri and tal are tending to zed. zed is now old, gray, haggard and feeble... and blinded by maax's priests.the door to the cell suddenly closes; through the small grate in the door, maax and one of the witchwomen are visible. the witch assures maax that dar is the one of whom the prophecy spoke, and maax decrees they will all be sacrificed in the morning. ruh comes charging down the corridor, and maax and the witchwoman hurriedly enter the cell, closing the door behind them to keep ruh out. maax orders the witchwoman to kill dar.dar draws his sword and squares off with the witchwoman, who flicks her fingers and makes a flash that blinds dar. tal runs at maax and tries to hit him with his fists, but the youth is still not grown or strong enough to hurt him. maax pulls a knife and holds it at tal's throat to keep kiri at bay.hissing malevolently, the witchwoman backs against the wall and begins to slither up it, and onto the ceiling, preparing to drop down on dar from above. but ruh can still see through the grate, and while dar is still blinded, he can see through ruh's eyes. he thrusts his sword straight up and then turns in a half-circle, killing the witchwoman.in the distraction, kiri pulls a slim silver chain from a wrist bracer and snares maax's knife hand, forcing him to drop the knife. ruh breaks down the cell door and advances threateningly on the high priest, roaring. knowing he cannot face down the mighty beast while alone and unarmed, maax drops down into a hidden back corridor and escapes while tal tends to zed. the old king is coming to; he's still alive, still aware, and he assures dar he can walk.meanwhile, the death guard continues its pursuit of kodo and podo. the clever ferrets run through old pipes along the walls, but the death guard is relentless; when they run underneath a gap at the bottom of a closed door, the death guard simply smashes it apart.kiri leads the group to a chamber at the bottom of the ziggurat. tal turns a lever that lifts a heavy stone carved into a skull shape, that conceals a stairway out of the temple. dar tells ruh to go first, and to protect tal, zed and kiri while he covers their escape. kiri begs dar to come with them, as the stairway is the only means of escaping the city, but dar says he can't leave without kodo and podo.alerted to the sound of banging, dar returns to the door. half a dozen jun priests with long knives are searching for him. seeing him peering through the door, they charge at him with bloodthirsty yells. dar closes and bars the door, and cuts the pulley to drop the skull-stone back over the stairway entrance. this door also happens to be where kodo and podo are running toward; still hauling the cell keys with them. they run under the feet of the priests and under a gap in the door, and the priests all turn and scream in terror as they see the death guard running straight toward them.kiri returns as dar collects kodo and podo. gathering the rope from the pulley, she tells dar they can use it to escape via the air shaft. the death guard smashes through the door and mindlessly pursues dar and kiri through the shaft. as they climb down the cliffside with the aid of the rope, the death guard swipes madly at the rope with its spike-shod arm. sherak flies at the death guard, clawing at its hooded head with his talons. the death guard leans too far out of the shaft and plunges to its death.the rope breaks and dar and kiri fall-- but sacco is there, and their fall is broken by the soft hay of his wagon. sacco snaps the reins for the wagon's horse, spurring it into a run toward the city gates; but maax has put the gate guards on alert and it is closed. dar asks if the gate has a counterweight; when kiri tells him that it does, he puts kodo and podo in another loop of string and has sherak carry them up to the top of the gate tower to gnaw through the heavy ropes that control it, so that it will raise.as the ferrets get to work, dar and sacco hear the sounds of monstrous growling. three death guards are running madly toward them, spurred by a mounted jun priest wielding a whip. dar tells sacco to start full speed for the gate; their only hope is to trust that kodo and podo will get it open.the guard in the tower turns and notices podo gnawing the control ropes. raising his sword, he takes hold of the ferret's tail and repositions it for a killing blow. seeing this, kodo creeps under the guard's skirt and delivers a punishing bite right where it will do the most hurt. screaming, the guard reflexively brings his sword down, cutting the rope the rest of the way so that the gate's counterweight starts to pull it up. sacco reaches the gate just as it raises enough so that his wagon can pass through. as they reach the gate, dar swings his sword and cuts the counterweight rope. the death guards try to slide under the gate, but are not fast enough, and it crushes them all beneath it. kodo and podo drop down from the top of the wall into the hay of sacco's wagon, and he rides off.everyone is gathered together at the taran valley. seth has put together thirty-five warriors. zed's spirit is still as strong as ever, but he has become far too single-minded in his desire for vengeance, for his own good. when dar issues a warning that killing maax and his priests will only incur the wrath of the jun horde, and more soldiers are needed to counter this, zed calls him a freak and shouts that he needs no cowards beside him. zed's rejection hurts dar badly, and he leaves the camp with ruh, a tear rolling down his face. sitting on a rock, dar scrawls a rough outline of a circle with a line through it; a symbol of his home village of emir.kiri comes up to him, though only for a moment's comfort; she is honor-bound to her duty to zed, and she cannot speak against or defy her uncle and king. she sadly tells dar that nobody will oppose zed after he cast dar out. zed is more than just a deposed king; he's still the people's symbol of hope.as kiri returns to camp, zed is starting to outline a plan of attack on aruk to defeat maax. tal has dozed off, and the eye-ring on his hand opens. maax flashes an evil grin as he listens to zed's attack plan.seth turns, and notices the open eye in the ring. maax's grin vanishes as the eye turns toward seth, and it's clear he sees it and understands what it is. seth grabs a small stick from the campfire and presses it into the eye, putting it out, before pulling the ring off tal's hand and tossing it into the campfire. he tells zed that maax has overheard the whole conversation and knows the attack plan, and will be prepared. but so utterly single-minded is zed that he cannot see any turn of events other than total defeat and death for maax. seth knows better; it is his forces that will face this fate.dar awakens in the morning; his animal companions at his side. looking around, he senses trouble. getting to higher ground, he sees sacco riding on a horse, leading another. dar calls out to sacco, who tells him that the attack on maax failed; zed, tal, seth and kiri were all taken alive, and are set to be sacrificed at the temple of ar at sunset. dar quickly mounts the second horse and rides with sacco back to aruk.at the temple of ar, maax and the last surviving witchwoman stand atop the ziggurat as a wagon brings seth, tal, and kiri. all three are dressed in sacrificial robes; their hands tied with leather strips. kiri is pulled out of the wagon and dragged up to the top of the ziggurat. beside the sacrificial fire pit, zed is tied to a chair. maax tells the people of aruk that zed has defied the will of ar, and now he and his kin will die.dar rides into aruk just as the priests drag kiri to the top of the ziggurat. the crowd quickly parts as he rides straight for the ziggurat. he tosses his pack into the wagon, and kodo and podo dart out, chewing through the leather thongs that bind tal and seth. dar storms the ziggurat, attacking any guards or priests in his way. sacco and the townspeople throw a sword and staff to seth and tal, who join in the battle. ruh leaps at a guard, who drops his weapon and backs against the wall of the ziggurat, screaming in fear before he is mauled to death.kiri is thrust down onto the ziggurat as she continues to fight. she bites one priest's hand and starts to break free, before she is clubbed on the head with a sword pommel and knocked out. maax raises his knife to kill kiri, but the shouts of the townspeople alert him that dar is almost at the top of the ziggurat, and all of the townspeople themselves are starting to grapple the guards, wrestling them for their spears. the witchwoman tells maax that he is doomed; the unborn son has come for him.maax raises his knife again, but dar is at the top of the ziggurat, starting to cut through the priests. maax goes to zed, holding his knife at the king's chest. dar finishes all of the priests and swings his sword menacingly in front of maax. holding the knife, maax then reveals to both zed and dar that they are father and son; dar is the unborn child stolen from his mother's womb. his eyes wide, dar puts his sword down on the floor of the ziggurat roof. but despite this, maax kills zed with a rake of his knife through the king's chest, and then lunges at dar, grappling with him. fighting his way back to his feet, dar forces maax's arms around and down, driving maax's own knife into his stomach.retrieving his sword, dar turns to the last witchwoman, who cowers beside a stone urn. as dar advances on her, the witchwoman turns away. dar thrusts his sword at her back, but her cloak is empty; dar sees a white bird flying away. dar goes to kiri, who recovers consciousness and smiles at him. lifting her in his arms, dar goes to the edge of the ziggurat's top.seth, tal, and the townspeople overpower the remaining guards and rush up the ziggurat in triumph. maax is overthrown. the townspeople cheer in victory.but in fact, though grievously wounded, maax is still alive. pulling the knife from his stomach, he struggles to his feet and staggers toward dar from behind, intent on killing him.kodo and podo have scampered up the ziggurat and reached the top. maax is almost on top of dar, who remains unaware of the high priest. kodo doesn't think twice. leaping as high as he can, the ferret lands on maax's shoulder, biting his neck. maax screams in agony, clutching at kodo-- and loses his balance, tumbling into the sacrificial fire, taking kodo with him. shouting in desperation, dar darts toward the fire, but cannot reach into it. kodo is lost. podo peers sadly into the fire at the loss of its mate before dar picks the ferret up and holds it against his chest.from his vantage point, tal sees something on the horizon. a huge dust cloud is moving slowly but inexorably toward aruk. as maax had foretold, the jun horde has returned to aruk. seth tells tal that it's his decision on whether to fight or flee. tal looks at dar. holding podo close against him, dar tells the people that it's time to stand and fight.preparations are made with speed. the bridge is pulled back, and the townspeople furiously shovel dirt over the moat to cover it so that it appears as solid ground. meanwhile, dar sits on the steps of the ziggurat. he pulls out the medallion given to him by the bat-bird-men and looks at it. calling to sherak, dar tosses the medallion to the eagle and sends him to the great tree to summon aid.it is night time. the townspeople anxiously wait the arrival of the juns. as the rumbling of the horde's horses grows louder, dar mentions to seth that tar was a rite of manhood and test of strength in emir. hopefully the juns will fail.the jun horde rides into view, stopping a few dozen yards short of the wall. the people of aruk and the jun barbarians stare each other down in a tension filled moment. then the jun leader silently raises his massive greatclub and points toward the town, signaling the juns to attack. the juns ride forward, slaughter on their minds. seth's plan pays off as the juns ride straight into the moat; their horses falling into the tar. the people of aruk cheer. a lookout just in front of the gate lights a torch and runs to light the moat aflame.but although mired in tar, the juns are far from down. they begin loosing bolts from their crossbows, taking down the lookout and a sentry perched atop the town gate. tal runs to the fallen lookout, grabbing his torch, only to be wounded by another crossbow bolt. the wounded sentry manages to release the gate controls to close the gate. dar and kiri roll underneath and clear before it closes. as kiri tends to tal, a jun barbarian climbs out of the tar and advances on her, sword raised to cleave her in two. kiri grabs the torch and thrusts it at the jun, setting him aflame. dar runs at the burning barbarian and kicks him back into the tar moat. sheets of flame roar out across the moat as the tar is ignited. seth climbs over the gate, joining with dar and kiri.more jun barbarians crawl out of the burning moat; some still riding on horseback. dar, kiri and seth fight with all their fury and strength, taking down several juns. but still more crawl out of the moat and surround them on all sides, driving the three until they are back to back to back. the juns fence and poke at them with their swords, looking for openings.the jun leader spurs his horse, leaping over the burning moat and into the fray. the jun soldiers part way for him, pointing his massive greatclub, the jun leader challenges dar to single combat. the jun leader's greatclub has two small blades at the heavy end protruding to either side, and he can detach the pommel to swing the weapon as a flail. he bashes downward and the blade gets stuck in the bridge. drawing a sword, he picks up the fight. leaping off the bridge, dar tackles the jun leader off his horse and retrieves his sword. their blades clash and the jun leader grapples with dar, slamming him against the bridge so that his sword goes flying, and then throwing him to the ground and retrieving his greatclub. the jun leader whirls the massive greatclub around by the pommel and chain, again bashing downward, and again one blade lodges in the bridge. dar stuns the jun leader with several kicks and grabs the jun leader's legs, taking them out from under him. as the jun leader falls, the other blade of his greatclub lodges in his back. the wounded leader struggles to his feet, but dar looses a swinging round kick to his helmeted head, knocking him down, and then grabs his arm, using it to fling the jun leader into the flaming tar.recovering his sword, dar makes his way back into the circle, back to back to back with seth and kiri. the remaining barbarians seem ready to descend on the trio and finish what their fallen leader started. enough juns remain that the death of dar, kiri and seth seems certain, no matter how many juns they take with them.sherak swoops down, landing on dar's arm. the rustle of wings signals the arrival of the bat-bird-men. opening their massive wings, they each envelop a jun barbarian, devouring their victim. the bat-bird-men rout the remaining juns;"" a scant few barbarian survivors fleeing. the leader of the avian humanoids looks at dar, giving him a small nod before leading his own people back home. the gate is raised and dar, seth and kiri pull a wounded tal back into the city. the people of aruk cheer in victory.some time later, dar is preparing to leave aruk. tal is healing well, although one of his arms will be weak and difficult to use for some time. dar gives something wrapped in leather to seth, as a gift to the new king.seth suddenly grabs dar's hand, looking closely at the mark there. the brand is a rough likeness of the front face of the temple ziggurat. having been there when maax made the pronouncement, seth knows what the mark means. he tells dar that he is the rightful king, as firstborn.but dar has not led a life appropriate to a future ruler. he can't be tied down to a throne. he is sure that tal will be a great leader, for he already has the best right hand that one could ask for. dar and seth clasp forearms in farewell. a number of villagers watch as dar and ruh walk side by side toward the gate. as the two pass through the open gate and out of aruk, kiri is seen running after dar.tal takes the gift dar left him to the ziggurat temple. wrapped in the piece of leather is dar's throwing kapa.sherak is perched on a totem atop the ziggurat. seth comes up beside tal, and the two of them, and sherak, all look into each other's eyes for a brief moment, before the eagle takes flight again, to rejoin his master.as dar stands on a high bluff, kiri comes up behind him. whether she is bidding him farewell or choosing to go with him is left for the viewer to decide. kiri kisses dar passionately as podo pokes its head out of dar's belt pouch, sniffing noses with ruh. two baby ferrets borne by podo follow suit. the last shot is kiri and dar kissing, from sherak's birds-eye view as he circles high above."""",cult"" ""356,vampires: los muertos,""""note: sequel to john carpenter's vampires (1998).los muertos picks up after the vampires went south into mexico and father guiteau stashed the bersier"" cross in a monastery. vampire hunter derek bliss [jon bon jovi] has been commissioned to seek and destroy some vampires in northern mexico before they can move north to san diego and other places in the u.s. the only problem is that the unnamed client wants to hire a team, not someone working solo. getting together a team is a bit difficult for derek because everyone on chief brody's recommended list keeps turning up dead. father guiteau, who was a member of the original team lead by jack crow, died last month. all the priests at the monastery where he moved the bersier cross were killed by vampires only a day or two after derek came looking for guiteau.eventually, derek manages to put together a team, unlikely as it is. it consists of zoey [natasha wagner] (a woman he met in a diner who was bitten by a vampire but who has been able to keep the turning in remission by taking some anti-hiv pills she got in mexico city), father rodrigo[cristian de la fuente] (the only priest who escaped the massacre at the monastery), sancho [diego luna] (a 15-year old boy who accompanied derek on a vampire hunt and who found that he had a penchant ""for it), and ray collins [darius mccrary] (a tall, muscular, black, ex-military, """"""""tough as"" ""nails"""""""" guy recruited in memphis by brody). to help with the hunt, rodrigo"" offers derek the use of guiteau's vampire-hunting bus, which is outfitted with all the winches and gizmos that are needed to hunt vampires (or ""suckers,"""""""" as the team calls them).the attack on the monastery, rodrigo explains, was led by the new"" female master una [arly jover] in order to get back the bersier cross. it looks like she intends to again perform the ritual which the suckers believe will allow them to walk during the day. after meeting up with collins in nogales, they cross over into mexico. zoey, due to her blood connection with the vampires, has a vision of una performing the ceremony, but it doesn't seem to have worked. the sun still hurts her. given a map of mexico, zoey is able to pinpoint where she thinks the bloodsuckers are hiding...someplace called salina, near some old toltec ruins. they stop for the night to sleep, but collins is getting claustrophobic in the little bus and chooses to sleep outside. during the night, he is, unknown to anyone, bitten by una. the next day is spent driving further into mexico. they know that they are getting close when they stop for gas and cold drinks and find that everyone in the diner has been slaughtered.the next morning, they near salina. rather than going directly to the ruins, they stop in salina where the residents are celebrating the day of ""the dead (""""""""los muertos"""""""" means """"""""the dead""""""""). when zoey goes to take her"" meds, she finds them missing and says that she must go immediately to mexico city. actually, una has them, and she's downed every last one. this gives una the ability, albeit it temporary, to move about during daylight, and she uses that opportunity to find and kidnap zoey. rodrigo puts 2+2 together and concludes that una took zoey's meds. but the only ones who had access to them were the rest of the team, so derek holds them all at gunpoint, trying to find the culprit. turns out that it was collins, who is shot by an old man they just met that morning in salina. with his dying breath, collins reveals that the client who hired them is none other than una.although they now know that this entire vampire hunt is a set-up, the remaining team members plus the old man, filling in for collins, go to the ruins to rescue zoey. zoey has fallen into a deep shaft and needs to be lifted out. derek tosses her a rope, telling the old man to stay far enough behind him to watch his back while still keeping his eye on rodrigo and sancho, who are closer to the exit. while they are so separated, una attacks derek. just as she's about to bite his neck, fr rodrigo offers una a deal. let his friends go, and he'll offer himself, as a priest, to perform the ceremony. in addition, he points out, he is also a hunter--two of the necessary elements of the ritual. una agrees.rodrigo stays with una while the others go to a clinic where zoey is transfused with blood while her infected blood is removed in hopes that this will slow her turning. then derek gets a brainstorm. he asks the nurse to transfuse zoey's tainted blood into him so that he can slow his heartbeat and infiltrate the vampires without being noticed. as the sun sets, the team goes back to the ruins where the ritual is taking place. una has slit rodrigo's leg and drunk a cup of his blood when rodrigo mentions that the ritual won't work because he was merely a hired hand at the monastery, not a priest at all. ha ha, fooled you! derek, whose plan to lurk is working, shoots several suckers, saves rodrigo from being burned alive, and fires an arrow through una. unfortunately, the winch is on the fritz, and they can't pull her out into the sun.so, they fix the winch and go back into the ruins. sancho ropes una, una grabs derek, zoey pulls both una and derek out into the sun, derek shoots off una's head, and una burns up.

34,Titan A.E.,"""by the year 3028 a.d., deep space travel and interaction with a plethora of alien races is commonplace for humanity and, as often happens with the passage of time, a new discovery is made. as electricity and splitting the atom were in history, what comes to be known as the titan project proves to be a profound scientific advance in mankind's role in the universe""; a testament to their strength and imagination. however, it is explained that this marvel does not go unnoticed. the drej, an alien race comprised entirely of energy, deems the human race a threat and advance their armada on earth to destroy the titan project and what they see as mankind's last chance of being a dominant force in the galaxy.five year-old cale (alex d. linz) puts the last touches on his latest invention, a hydro-powered console, before it accidentally breaks in a small creek. his father, sam tucker (ron perlman) comes to collect him, explaining that they have to leave. he takes his son to the nearby base where he is stationed and where evacuation pods filled with people are being sent into space. sam places cale in the care of family friend and guardian tek (tone loc) before explaining that he has to go away for a while. he gives cale a gold ring and tells him that, as long as he wears it, there will be hope. then, despite cale's pleas, sam is escorted by friend joseph korso (bill pullman) to a nearby hangar as cale is brought aboard an evacuation pod with tek. reports of drej fighters attacking civilian pods ring out as cale's ship takes off. he watches as his father runs inside and activates the titan project; a large, spherical ship which manages to fly past the incoming drej and uses its hyperdrive to vanish into outer space. at a safe distance, cale watches as the drej mothership, commanded by the queen drej (christopher scarabosio), hones in on earth and destroys it in one shot with a massive energy blast.fifteen years later, cale (christopher scarabosio) works in a salvage yard in asteroid belt tau 14. the human population has dwindled severely over the past few years and the race is considered inferior to other alien species, constantly ridiculed and rumored to be near extinction. impatient and tired of constantly being shoved to the back of the line, cale defiantly rides his scooter away from the check-out point to the nearest hangar entrance, only to collide with a docking ship. he is propelled onto the bow of the ship and briefly gets a glimpse of the young female pilot within before she closes the shield doors. the pilot then sends a com-link message to the disembarking captain, reminding him that they are on a time schedule. cale makes it inside and begins to wash up before he's confronted by two fellow alien workers who express distaste with cale's line-jumping stunt. they begin to beat him up to teach him a lesson before the captain of the newly-arrived ship intervenes and lassos the aliens. he introduces himself as joseph korso and says he's been searching for cale who carries mankind's last salvation. skeptical and disheartened to hear that korso was a friend of his father's, cale refuses to cooperate and reunites with tek in the galley who seems rather disinterested in cale's complaints.korso, meanwhile, is alerted by pilot akima (drew barrymore) that their time limit has been cut with the arrival of a few drej fighters. with the mounting pressure, korso follows cale into the galley and greets tek as an old friend, to cale's astonishment. korso then shows cale the reason he's there; he takes cale's ring and uses a pen to activate a minute code within the lining before replacing it on cale's finger. the ring projects a holographic map onto the palm of cale's hand. korso explains that the ring was coded to sam's dna, and is thus to cale's. the map is supposed to lead to where sam hid the ship the titan and, if they find it before the drej do, they will be able to give the human race something they haven't had in years; a new planet to call home. at that moment, two drej fighters enter the galley and immediately target cale. korso disables the artificial gravity generator at the back of the kitchen and he and cale follow the cowardly cook (jim breuer) through an escape hatch. they make it to a warehouse and hijack a construction vehicle with the drej in hot pursuit. cale is injured in the escape and korso pilots the vehicle straight through a closed dock and into space. he calls for akima to pick them up as the windshield on the vehicle cracks. korso kicks it out and uses a fire extinguisher to propel him and cale into the hold of the valkyrie.when cale wakes, he meets akima face to face along with the sly first mate, preed (nathan lane), before he is introduced to the rest of the crew including stith (janeane garofalo), the surly weapons specialist, and gune (john leguizamo), the eccentric astronomer. cale is brought to gune who reads the map on his palm and determines that their next heading should be to sesharrim, a planet that, as korso recalls, is home to the ancient gaoul race. after arriving, preed and gune are left at the ship to watch for the drej while the others take a boat across a lake filled with hydrogen-pod trees. they find the remnants of a temple and are suddenly surrounded by bat-like creatures. before korso can open fire, akima determines that they are the gaoul. the lead gaoul approaches cale and instructs him through pantomime to hold his palm up towards the planet's prominent star. held against the sky, cale sees the arrow on the map pointing towards the distant andali nebula where the titan is surely hidden. suddenly, drej fighters descend on the planet and attack the group. the gaoul assist the group escape to their boat as preed and gune, having been distracted from their post, struggle to get the valkyrie airborne again. the gaoul use the hydrogen pods on the trees to destroy some of the fighters but, in the chaos, cale and akima are knocked off the boat. before korso can retrieve them, a drej ship locks onto them with its tractor beam and escapes into outer space. it takes cale and akima to the drej mothership where akima, of no use, is expelled into space in a pod. cale is then held before the queen and forced to open his palm, giving the drej a complete copy of the map detailing where the titan is hidden. cale is then sent into confinement.meanwhile, korso and preed are able to track akima's location to a prison block on a nearby planet. they attempt to disguise themselves as a slave trader and his subordinate but the guard (charles rocket) displays higher-than-average intelligence. so they use force and make their way towards the cell where akima is resting atop her pod, unconscious invalids on the ground around her.on board the drej mothership, cale discovers that he can manipulate the energy keeping him locked inside to release himself. he escapes to the main hangar and commandeers a drej ship, flying out into space with a scouting party. he is able to catch up to the valkyrie although the crew nearly mistakes him for another drej scout. safe again, cale and korso have a heart-to-heart and cale is allowed to pilot the valkyrie through a tract of space. putting his piloting skills to the test, cale playfully races a band of 'space angels', creatures that dwell in nebular matter. the crew then makes a pit stop at a human drifter colony called new bangkok to repair the ship and pick up supplies. however, as cale and akima return to the ship with a few necessities, they overhear korso speaking to a holographic link with the queen drej. korso argues with her that cale is his responsibility and he alone will use him to find the titan, though the queen asserts that, despite their agreement, the drej will do whatever is necessary to assure the titan's destruction. cale and akima turn away straight into preed's gun and he leads them inside where they are confronted by korso. korso admits that he made a deal with the drej; that he would lead them to the titan with the assurance of his own survival and for the hefty bounty. no longer wanting to believe that the human race is destined for extinction, cale fights korso and preed and manages to escape the ship with akima, though she is wounded in the process. with cale and akima safely in new bangkok, korso takes the valkyrie and leaves for the andali nebula.akima and cale are assisted by the locals including an old woman (tsai chin) who assures them that akima merely needs rest. while waiting, cale meets a young girl (crystal scales) and her brother who shows cale that a little imagination is all that's needed to envision a better place to live rather than just accepting what is. encouraged, cale later tells akima, fully healed, that he plans to beat korso to the titan using an old ship at the colony. with the help of other able-bodied humans, cale and akima are able to repair and refit the old phoenix and blast off towards the nebula.the andali nebula's center is a thick ring of ice crystals which makes for extremely tricky navigation. korso and preed struggle to maintain a steady course as cale and akima come up behind them. they use the reflective surface of the ice to create an illusion as they sneak right by the ship before igniting their engines full thrust and making a break for the titan. the valkyrie tries to follow, but the ever-shifting ice blocks their path. cale and akima make it to the center of the ice pack and finally discover the resting place of the titan. they find a hatch to dock at and make their way inside. akima finds a library stacked with vials that are revealed to be genetic information for all animals and plant life that were found on earth. meanwhile, the valkyrie finds the titan and docks at an alternate entrance. korso and preed prepare to disembark and instruct gune and stith to stay behind. however, the pair are suspicious of korso's intentions. they are proven right when preed sends a com-link message to stith's watch which proceeds to beep in a countdown. gune removes stith's watch and runs off before it explodes. stith awakes in the rubble unharmed but finds gune apparently injured. he announces that he needs to take a brief nap before he falls still.cale and akima make their way to the main console at the center of the ship where cale finds his old invention, completely repaired, and activates a message from his father. the image explains that the ship has the power to create an entirely new planet for humans but that, in its escape, the ship used up all of its auxillary power. he begins to go over the initiation process to restore power until a shot rings out and the message ends. korso appears and demands cale's ring but preed suddenly presses his gun to korso's head. he announces that he made a separate deal with the drej; that he could live provided he killed everyone else before their imminent arrival. korso fights back and manages to overpower preed, breaking his neck. cale then tackles korso and they both fall over the edge of the platform. cale is able to grab onto a piece of rigging and climb back onto the main platform but korso falls further until he grasps a wire which leads him back onto the main unit. at that moment, an alert sounds; the drej have arrived.stith is reunited with cale and akima and she activates the controls to the exterior guns, blasting away at the drej fighters. cale struggles to think of a way to beat the drej and activate the titan until he remembers that the drej are pure energy. he is able to harness into their energy and restart the internal power system, but one of the circuit breakers located outside malfunctions. cale has no choice but to go out and fix it manually. stith provides cover until all guns are shot out by the drej. cale is cornered by drej fire until korso appears and offers to help. they work together to fix the circuit until korso is gravely injured. he opts to stay behind, effectively sacrificing himself in order to unjam the circuit. as cale escapes back into the titan, he is covered by gune piloting the valkyrie;"" apparently having recovered from his nap. korso uses his gun to link the circuits and is electrocuted in the process. cale makes it back to the main platform and uses his ring to activate the ship just as the drej mothership targets the titan. a blast is sent out from the titan and the drej are disintegrated, their energy sucked into the titan's engines. waves of energy expand from the center of the ice ring and swirl it together towards the center. the titan flies out of the core as gravity takes over and a new planet is formed, the remaining ice melting into vast seas.cale and akima step foot onto the new planet and akima asks what they should call it. cale decides to name the planet 'bob', despite akima's protests. they kiss and watch as gune and stith fly the valkyrie above them in a victorious sweep. meanwhile, ships and colonies of the surviving humans have received word of their new home and all flock to claim it. year 16 a.e., for 'after earth', introduces us to 'new earth', aka 'planet bob'.""",cult

501,Ed Wood,"""the film opens with a thunderstorm. lightning flashes illuminate a spooky old house, accompanied by the eerie wailing of a theremin. the camera moves inside the house to reveal a coffin which opens and from the coffin criswell sits up. (this is nearly identical to opening scene to night of the ghouls). criswell offers an opening commentary which practically repeats the opening commentary from plan 9 from outer space. credits follow with most of the cast names displayed on tombstones (again similar to plan 9). the camera moves from the hollywood sign and down into hollywood itself.it is a rainy night outside a dilapidated theater in hollywood. it is the early 1950s. the eccentric and goof-ball theater director edward d. wood jr. (johnny depp) is pacing outside, waiting for the press who have not shown to review his play the casual company, a world war ii-esq military drama. the show finally goes on to an almost empty house. later that night ed, his close friend john """"""""bunny"""""""" breckinridge (bill murray) and the three principal actors in the play, dolores fuller (sarah jessica parker), paul marco (max casella) and conrad """"""""connie"""""""" brooks (brent hinkley) read victor crowley's scathing review of the play, the only positive comment being about the realistic costumes. later that night ed, who is living with dolores, expresses his doubts about his achieving success in the film industry. he worries that he's nearly thirty and orson welles, whom ed idolizes, was 26-years old when he made """"""""citizen kane"""""""". dolores reassures him and then absent-mindedly makes a comment to herself about never being able to find her clothes. ed turns over in bed with a worried look on his face.a few days later, ed is working in the props department at a film studio as his second job and he is asked to take a potted palm over to the executive offices. ed makes a bit of a side trip to see some new stock footage the studio received, and comments that he could probably make a complete movie using just the stock footage. later, in the office he overhears two office girls discussing an article in variety about a bio-pic being considered about sex-change personality, christine jorgensen.ed phones george weiss (mike starr), head of screen classics, a small studio which specializes in soft-core sexploitation films, which was making the bio-pic. ed assures him that he is the most qualified man in hollywood to direct the sex-change film. later ed is talking to weiss in his office who tells him that the christine jorgensen story is off. christine heard about it fromvariety, and was asking for too much. weiss was still planing a sex-change film though, to be called i changed my sex. he has no script yet or director. ed tells him that he can direct and write the movie. when weiss asks him why he is the most qualified man in hollywood to do this movie ed tells him he himself is a cross-dresser and can add an extra note of realism to the movie. weiss tells ed that he does not need someone who has a burning desire to tell his story. discouraged, ed leaves.on his way home, ed meets bela lugosi (martin landau). he is leaving a funeral home complaining about the uncomfortableness of the coffins. the two start talking and begin a close friendship as ed drives bela home to his small house. ed learns that bela has not worked in four years. later, ed is discussing bela with weiss who calls bela a """"""""washed-out junkie"""""""". he suggests that if ed thinks he is so great he should hire bela himself.on halloween night 1953, and ed and bela are watching white zombie at bela's home on the tv. the show breaks for a commercial, introduced by horror-show hostess vampira (lisa marie) whom bela refers to as """"""""a honey"""""""". a short while later, vampira makes a comment about the film starring bela lugosi """"""""and a bunch of other people i've never heard of"""""""". this seems to depress bela who goes into the back to take his """"""""medicine"""""""". the medicine seems to work almost immediately and bela is soon cheerfully scaring trick-or-treating children as dracula.using the promise of getting bela to star in the movie, ed convinces george weiss to let him write and direct the movie. he finishes the script two days later and gives it to dolores to read. he also uses the script to tell her about his own cross-dressing. he shows himself to her dressed in one of her angora jumpers, and he offers her the role of barbara in the movie. they begin filming the movie, now re-titled 'glen or glenda', with ed himself performing the title roles. when they get to filming bela's scenes, there is a minor catastrophe when connie mentions boris karloff. bela gets highly upset about this, as karloff was a major of rival of lugosi's. there is also trouble on the set as dolores, who is playing the female lead barbara, is having a very hard time accepting ed's cross-dressing. somehow the film is finished. when it is shown to weiss, he doesn't like it at all.ed takes a film copy of glen or glenda to mr. feldman at warners, seeking to get financial backing to continue making movies. he mentions several other projects he has planned, such as the ghoul goes west and dr. acula. feldman seems interested in another project ed pitches, bride of the atom. later feldman and two subordinates view glen or glenda, and are reduced to fits of helpless laughter by the horrible looking movie with bad sound, lighting, and acting.days later, ed finds that glen or glenda is not playing anywhere local. he phones george weiss who tells him that he could not sell it anywhere in the major markets. in fact, the furious weiss wishes """"""""he had not blown every dime he had ever made into making this stink-bomb"""""""". he angrily promises that if he ever sees ed again, he will kill him.a few evenings later ed, dolores and bunny are at a wrestling match. bunny talks about his plans to go to mexico and take the first steps leading to sex-reassignment, much to dolores' discomfort. they later see in action swedish wrestler tor johnson (george 'the animal' steele), who ed believes would make a fantastic actor, and would be perfect for lobo, the monstrous henchman in bride of the atom. he convinces tor to take the part.some months later, ed gets a call from bela. when he arrives at bela's home he finds bela collapsed on the floor. he also finds a needle syringe which bela tells him contains morphine and demerol. bella breaks down and tells ed that he is totally broke, and doesn't know what he's going to do to pay for his """"""""medication"""""""". ed reassures him that he won't let bela down.the next day, ed calls feldman, who tells him that glen or glenda was the worst movie he ever saw, and hangs up on him. discouraged, ed talks to dolores, who suggests that ed may not be studio material, and may do better as an independent film maker. ed starts to try to line up backers by meeting them at the local brown derby restaurant. one person he approaches is a producer of a comedy/variety tv series, who arranges to use bela in a sketch.the sketch turns out to be a total fiasco, as bela cannot follow the ad-libs of the comic. backstage ed and bela meet """"""""psychic"""""""" criswell (jeffrey jones) who predicts that bela's next project will be a huge success. criswell even recognises ed's name as the writer/director of """"""""glen or glenda"""""""". quickly criswell becomes a member of ed's growing entourage and tells ed that showmanship is the secret to success.over the next several months in 1955, ed continues seeking financing for his next movie, helped by dolores, criswell and tor, but without any success. one evening at a local nightclub, ed encounters a young, attractive woman who introduces herself as loretta king (juliet landau) who appears to be quite wealthy (she pays a three dollar bar tab with a $50 note). still seeking financing, ed soon convinces her to invest in bride of the atom. loretta agrees to finance ed's movie, but her only catch is that in exchange to be credited as one of the executive producers, she would also like to act in the movie, in fact she wants to take the lead role, which ed had already promised to dolores. ed reluctantly agrees with loretta so that he can make the movie. dolores, however, is furious about this, especially when she finds she has been relegated to one of the minor roles.with loretta's contribution in hand ed begins filming, despite loretta being a mediocre actress. unfortunately, filming is soon shut down a few days later when the $300 advance that loretta gave runs out. it turns out that the $300 was all the money that loretta had. so ed goes back out on the financing trail. while talking to some potential investors at the brown derby, he meets vampira at the restaurant with her entourage of her agent, manager, publicist, producer, etc. he tries to interest her in helping to get some backers, but her reluctance ends up losing backers.ed ends up talking to butcher donald mccoy, a redneck hick who is willing to advance ed the rest of the money he needs, but mccoy's condition is that he wants the movie to end with a big explosion, and that the lead male role to go to his son tony. after making the suggested changes, filming resumes, but not without problems. at one point there is a very tense encounter between dolores and loretta in the dressing room over dolores still angry and jealous at loretta for taking the lead role which ed promised her first.that night, ed, paul, connie, criswell, and tor break into the prop warehouse at republic studios to """"""""borrow"""""""" a rubber octopus to be used in the climactic scene between dr. vornoff (bela), and his octopus. the following night, while on location in the hollywood hills to film that scene, they realise that they forgot to borrow the octopus motor, so when they are filming the scene ed tells bela to just """"""""shake his legs around so it looks like he's killing you"""""""". at first bela seems to be unable to do the scene, but after injecting himself with a dose of his """"""""medicine"""""""" he is alright again.at the wrap party the next night, held in mccoy's butcher shop, ed, once more in drag, does a strip act. this is the last straw, and dolores explodes, saying that ed's movies are terrible. she leaves ed for good.in april 1955, ed gets another phone call from bela, whom he finds suicidal and wants ed to join him. ed talks bela out of it, and bela decides to commit himself into a hospital for his drug addiction. bela uses his rehabilitation to get some publicity and to get his name back in the press.in the hospital while waiting to visit bela, ed meets kathy o'hara (patricia arquette), a very sweet young woman whom is visiting her father at the hospital. ed becomes strangely attracted to her. he tells her that he is a writer, producer, actor, and director in motion pictures. the two go out on a date to a midway carnival. they take a ride through the spook house, which breaks down halfway through the ride. while stranded, ed confesses to kathy about his cross-dressing. she accepts it without question.the next morning, ed gets some bad news from the sanitarium. bela's insurance has long since lapsed and as a result bela will not be able to stay any longer. ed offers to pay all he has to help bela, but the small amount of money he has will barely help. ed convinces bela that he is cured, and takes him home. bela wonders when ed's next picture will be coming. to help bela, ed invests the last of his cash in some film and a camera rental. he and bela film several scenes of generic stock footage outside bela's house that ed could use almost anywhere for his next movie.some months later in early 1956, ed invites vampira to join the party going to the premiere of his movie, now re-titled bride of the monster. ed, kathy, vampira, criswell, bela, and tor go in ed's car to the theater. the audience is extremely rowdy over the horrible-looking movie and after only a few minutes into the picture ed begins to fear for the safety of his guests, especially kathy, bela, and vampira. they leave in time to catch a gang stripping down ed's car. the crowd soon leaves the theater also roaring in anger at being cheated out of their money to watch a bad movie. they hail a taxi"";"" in fact kathy almost has to jump in front of it to get it to stop. as they drive away, bela sarcasticaly remarks, """"""""now that was a premiere!""""""""the next day, ed and bela are walking along a sidewalk in los angeles and talking. bela tells ed that he has found a very special woman in kathy. they talk about the premiere and ed wishes that bela could have seen the whole movie. bela says he doesn't really need to, he remembers it all, and proves it by quoting his closing speech to an appreciative impromptu audience on the street.one night another few months later, ed gets woken up from a phone call where someone on the other line tells him that bela has passed away. ed, kathy, tor, criswell, vampira, connie, and paul are all among the mourners at bela's funeral. it is also mentioned that bela was buried in his dracula cape.another year or so later, ed is talking to his landlord, j. edward reynolds (clive rosengren). reynolds notices that ed is in the picture business, and mentions that his baptist church is planning to make inspirational films about the twelve apostles. at the present time though they only have the money for one. ed tells reynolds that if he took that money and put it into a commercially proven genre, he would make enough to make all twelve movies. as it happens, ed has a script he wrote available, entitled grave robbers from outer space, and this movie would star bela lugosi. ed has the last film bela did, and he just needs to hire a double to complete bela's scenes. reynolds agrees, and final preparations begin for the movie.when ed learns that vampira has been laid off, he convinces her to take a part in the film, but she will only do it mute. ed meets dr. tom mason, kathy's chiropractor, and ed hires him to be bela's double even though the resemblance is minimal, and the only way ed could pull it off is if mason does all his scenes with the dracula cape pulled over his face.reynolds will only support the movie if ed and his companions are baptised into his church. so that sunday, ed, kathy, vampira, tor, criswell, bunny, mason, paul, and connie are received into the local baptist church. tor is too large to fit into the regular baptismal font, so the mass baptism is held in a nearby swimming pool.in 1958, filming begins but with many problems. gregory wallcott, an actor who is also a member of reynolds' church choir who is taking one of the lead roles in the movie, is disgusted by the amateurish airplane cockpit set. bunny, who is playing the alien leader, is insisting on antenna or glitter for his costume. reynolds has many concerns, from daylight stock shots setting up for night scenes, as well as tor (who is nearly unintelligible due to his thick swedish accent) delivering several lines of dialogue because bela is dead, and vampira will not speak on camera, and the title grave robbers from outer space which they find blasphemous. the final straw is when reynolds questions ed's directing skills after paul and connie, (playing policemen) fall (knocked down by the passage of the 'flying saucer') and knock over one of the cardboard tombstones in the graveyard set. to relax, ed puts on his women's clothing only to be chastised even more by reynolds.ed storms out of the studio and goes to a nearby bar (still in drag). in the bar ed meets his idol, orson welles (vincent d'offrio). the two begin talking and orson reminisces about his problems with the film business. he tells ed that ultimately the business is worthwhile and advises ed to hang on to his dreams.ed returns to the studio and tells reynolds that he will get his movie, as ed wants to make it, and it will be successful.ed continues filming the movie, now re-titled plan 9 from outer space at reynolds' request. scene after scene are filmed with ed growing more and more proud of the whole production. he knows that """"""""this is the ultimate ed wood movie""""""""on opening night in 1959, he and kathy drive to the theater in ed's (repaired) convertible. as they arrive, it begins to rain and thunder, much like the storm in the opening scenes. the top gets stuck open, and finally ed leaves it so that they can make the premire. he introduces it simply """"""""for bela"""""""". as the film runs, ed is again in the wings silently repeating the dialogue. he knows that """"""""this is it. this is the one i'll be remembered for"""""""".as """"""""plan 9"""""""" closes he proposed to kathy, and the two drive off in his soaked car to marry in las vegas. the camera moves back from the area to focus on the hollywood sign again.the movie ends with short biographical comments about the major characters and their lives after plan 9 from outer space...edward d. wood jr. kept on struggling in hollywood, but mainstream success eluded him. he descended into obscurity, as well as alcoholism while continuing to direct grade-b monster and soft core sex films. he died from a heart attack in 1978 at age 54. two years after his death, he was voted """"""""worst director of all time""""""""

on a tree trunk that has fallen over a stream to 'hey! baby'. later as the song continues, they practice some lifts for their dance number in the nearby lake.at the sheldrake, johnny and baby dance to 'de todo un poco'. their performance goes reasonably well even though baby is so nervous that she aborts the dance's climactic lift.when johnny and baby get back to kellerman's, billy informs them that penny's abortion was botched by a quack. when baby sees penny in agonizing pain, she runs to get her father, who treats penny and asks who is responsible for penny, and johnny says he is, which dr. houseman mistakenly assumes means that johnny got penny pregnant.after saving penny's life and forbidding baby from having anything further to do with """"""""those people"""""""", baby defies her father and goes directly to johnny's cabin ('these arms of mine' playing in the background) and apologizes for the way her father reacted. johnny tells baby she's brave. she demurs, saying she was scared of never feeling for the rest of her life the way she feels when shes with him. when the record changes to 'cry to me', she asks him to dance with her, which turns into a dance of seduction... leading to baby and johnny having sex.the next day when baby visits penny to see how she's doing, johnny shows up. penny realizes that he and baby are having an affair so, after baby leaves, penny reminds johnny about his own admonition about not getting involved with the guests, but he doesn't listen. later we see johnny and baby in bed together with 'will you still love me tomorrow?' playing in the background.the next day while mickey and sylvia's recording of 'love is strange' plays, we see dancing on the lawn, a volleyball game in progress, and johnny and baby rehearsing a cha-cha. johnny, however, can't keep his mind on the dance. they lip sync the song, particularly the part about """"""""how do you call your lover boy? come here, lover boy ..."""""""". neil comes up the stairs, they hear him and hastily stop. neil wants to talk to johnny about doing something different for the final show of the season. johnny gets excited that he may be allowed to finally do his own thing this year, but all neil will allow is to replace the mambo with a pachenga. when neil leaves, baby scolds johnny for letting neil talk down to him, but johnny reminds her that he needs this job the following summer.a little later when baby and johnny are walking together, she has him duck so her father doesn't see them together. then johnny scolds her for not telling her father about their relationship.later she tracks johnny down in penny's room"";"" 'you don't own me' is playing in the background. robbie comes by, sees them, assumes johnny is having sex with baby, and makes a snide remark about having picked the wrong sister. johnny, furious at robbie for getting penny pregnant and abandoning her, beats him up.at a rehearsal for the final night talent show, lisa rehearses a pitiful hula number (un-named song), during which one of the women guests, vivian, tells johnny she's arranged """"""""something for the two of them"""""""" that evening. a few minutes later, vivian's husband, who plans to play cards all weekend, offers johnny a sizable tip to give his wife some extra dance lessons, but johnny declines, saying he's all booked up for the weekend, at which vivian is annoyed, but does nothing about it then.later that evening, lisa walks down the path toward the employee cabins, intending to allow robbie to finally make love to her (we hear 'yes' on the soundtrack.) when she reaches robbie's cabin, there is a towel hanging on the doorknob, which she does not recognize as a staff signal for """"""""do not disturb"""""""". first she knocks, then she enters, where she finds robbie in bed with vivian.cut to johnny and baby in bed together, again after another night of passion, with 'still of the night' playing. johnny tells her he dreamed they were walking together and met her father, who put his arm around him just like he had seen him do to robbie. later as johnny and baby kiss goodbye on the porch, vivian sees them together. vivian mutters: """"""""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.""""""""the next morning at breakfast, max tells the housemans that someone stole vivian's husband's wallet from his jacket while he was playing poker some time between 1:30am and 4:00am. johnny is the prime suspect, as vivian reported him in the vicinity at the time. baby protests that she knows johnny didn't do it, and to save him from being fired, confesses that she was with him in his cabin all night.... even though she knows her father will be angry.a little later, baby apologizes to her father for not telling him the truth, but also accuses him of not telling her the truth: she says he's always told her that everyone is equal and deserves a fair break, and that she should better the world, but what he really wanted was for her to become a lawyer or an economist and to marry someone from an ivy league school. dr. houseman is moved, but not enough to open up to her.johnny is eventually cleared of the theft charge when the police find the real thieves (an elderly couple named mr. and mrs. schumacher) but he is still fired for having a relationship with a guest. baby is distraught that johnny got fired anyway, but he is proud of her for standing up for her principles and selfless act. johnny and baby say goodbye. her loneliness is emphasized with 'she's like the wind' (sung by patrick swayze).the resort's finale for the season starts with neil leading the group in singing an alma mater song to kellerman's (to the tune of 'far above cayugas waters'). baby and her parents are seated at a corner table. lisa, dressed in her hula outfit, sings and dances.dr. houseman, who still views robbie as a fine, upstanding medical student, presses an envelope on him, presumably containing a sizable check for his medical studies. robbie thanks him, and expresses his appreciation for his understanding with the """"""""penny situation"""""""". suddenly realizing it was robbie who got penny pregnant, dr. houseman grabs the envelope and stalks away.during another chorus of the song, johnny returns, finds baby, and after expressing the now most memorable line in the movie """"""""nobody puts baby in the corner"""""""", escorts her to the stage. dr. houseman starts to object, but his wife restrains him. johnny escorts baby up onto the stage, interrupts the boring musical tribute to the resort, and announces that even though he's been fired, he always performs the last dance of the season. he announces that his partner will be not only a great dancer, but someone who proved that there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them. he introduces her as frances, as she's no longer a baby"";"" she's a young woman.johnny and baby dirty dance to 'i've had the time of my life', the energy in the entire hall picks up, and the rest of the staff join in. baby allows herself to trust both johnny and her own capabilities, as johnny lifts her high into the air as they'd been meant to do in their sheldrake performance (into the pose that became the most recognizable image from the film). the assembled guests catch the spirit of the dance and join in while max kellerman acknowledges that the world is changing quickly.while everyone is still dancing, baby and johnny head for some privacy, but are stopped at the door by dr. houseman, who apologizes to johnny and compliments baby on her performance. johnny and frances/baby return to the dance floor and johnny lip-syncs the song's lyrics about having the time of his life and owing it all to her. the film ends with the camera panning out and up to show everyone in the hall enjoying the dance.during the closing credits, we hear a reprise of 'yes' and more of cousin brucie's radio dj patter.""",cult

76,Vampires: The Turning,"""prologue: for many centuries, phi song neng (vampire spirits who have"" vowed never to drink human blood) have lived among the villages of the far east. one day, over 800 years ago, a young, human warlord named niran fell in love with a beautiful song neng woman named sang. niran wanted sang for his own, so he killed her husband and son. in her pain and rage, sang attacked niran during a songkran []new year] solar eclipse, turning him into a vampire. from niran have come many jai tham (vampires who drink human blood and kill humans for pleasure). only sang can end the jai tham's nightly attacks on humans. doing so, however, will end the entire bloodline and turn every vampire, song neng as well as jai tham, into mere mortals again. since the coming songkran festival will feature the first solar eclipse in 800 years, sang intends to kill herself by exposing herself to the sun's rays at the end of the eclipse and, thus, wipe out all the vampires in thailand.connor [colin egglesfield] and amanda [meredith monroe] are vacationing in thailand during this year's songkran festival. connor, trained since childhood in muay thai (thai boxing), takes amanda to see a match. however, amanda cannot take the brutality and goes back to their hotel alone. on the way, she gets lost in the phang nga market, and mr nice guy [dom hetrakul] offers to show her the way to her hotel. he leads her on a short cut down a deserted alley, then suddenly turns into the vampire niran, drinking her blood and carrying her off on a motorcycle. connor tries to follow, but he is stopped by another vampire, obviously intent on killing him. just as the vampire is about to succeed, a bald-headed man appears and chops off the vampire's head. connor begs for his help finding amanda, but he warns connor to leave thailand immediately and threatens to kill connor if he follows him. of course, connor steathfully (i.e., ten steps behind) follows kiko [roger yuan] home to kong sai house.when the police refuse to consider amanda missing until 48 hours have passed, connor goes back to kong sai house, only to find everyone asleep. while snooping through the house, connor is attacked by a female vampire [stephanie chao] (who turns out to be sang, but connor doesn't know that yet). connor gets away from her by jumping out a window. as connor lands on the ground below, he is stopped by vampire slayer raines [patrick bauchau] who insists on testing connor's blood to see if he is infected. when connor comes up clean, he begs raines to help him find amanda but, like kiko, raines warns him to leave thailand. amanda is as good as dead, he says. if she resists, the jai tham will bleed her dry; if not, they'll turn her, and then raines will slay her (he gets $10,000 for every vampire he kills). either way, amanda should be considered dead to connor.connor won't accept it and returns again to kong sai house. while there, he sees a photo of niran in front of the techno games arcade near the phang nga market. figuring that niran might have taken amanda there, he snoops around. he finds amanda being held in a cell with skeletons, carcasses, and other humans in various stages of being drained of their blood. basically, he's stumbled into the jai tham's pantry. amanda and connor escape but are attacked outside by two jai tham on a motorcycle. one drives off with amanda; the other stays to kill connor. just as niran and the rest of the jai tham arrive to join the fun, sang appears. connor grabs a motorcycle and, with sang riding behind him, they succeed in outrunning the jai tham.both amanda and connor are now faced with decisions. amanda must decide whether to allow niran to turn her or to keep on drinking from her, which causes acute pain. connor has to decide whether or not to join the song neng in hopes of winning the battle with the jai tham and helping sang to kill herself so that all vampires (including him) will be turned back into mortals. the alternative, if sang is not successful, is that connor will remain a vampire until the next songkran eclipse rolls around in 800 years and sang can try again. connor's decision is made doubly hard because he's got the hots for sang. amanda decides to continue resisting, and connor decides to become song neng. this requires being bitten by sang and, apparently, having sex with her, too.the day of the eclipse is upon them. the song neng have made a deal with the slayers. since sang's embrace of the sun must take place in the same spot where the curse began 800 years ago (a couple blocks away), the song neng have made a deal with raines. raines and his slayers will line the buildings and walls that overlook the site, which looks like an archeological dig, in order to kill any jai tham who try to stop sang. connor, kiko, and the rest of the song neng will help sang get to the required spot. the eclipse starts at 3:00, and they will have 17 minutes to do the job. all is set.suddenly, the sun is covered and the city falls dark. the slayers are in position. connor and the song neng move out from under the trees. the jai tham arrive on their motorcycles. in the melee that follows, connor and niran fall through a weak spot into a pit where they continue fighting. time is running out, and kiko realizes that the slayers have double-crossed them. suddenly, the slayers open fire, shooting everyone, song neng and jai tham. only connor and niran remain protected in their hole. connor manages to impale niran, but when he surfaces from the pit, connor finds only bodies. he shouts for sang, but there is no answer. raines walks up, gloating over how much he will get for all the vampire heads and those in the future. if sang ends the curse, he explains, there's no more vampires, and we're in the vampire hunting business.connor locates sang as raines turns his crossbow on her. connor offers to shoot sang so that she doesn't have to suffer. raines hands his bow to connor. connor aims at sang but suddenly swings his aim to raines. forcing raines to carry sang to the designated spot, connor gives her one last kiss before the sun reappears and sang is toast. she explodes, taking raines with her. connor hurries back to the jai tham's pantry and rescues amanda.epilog: connor and amanda are on an airplane flying back to the states. amanda looks out the window, and her eyes appear to be totally black. is she or ""isn't she?

both 'bad guys' and 'innocents.' at a dinner lesson, she becomes frustrated with the use of a knife and fork and finally starts to eat using her hands.bob and his supervisor, kaufman (miguel ferrer) notice, and are talking about her in kaufman's office. bob insists he can bring maggie back around, reminding kaufman that a young woman operative is needed 'out in the field.' he says recruits need up to two years to complete their lessons and training, but kaufman tells bob that maggie is only getting six months;

one of the men is a v.i.p. and the other man is his bodyguard. maggie is to kill the vip; two bullets minimum and go to the last stall of the men's room where a window leads to the courtyard, where a car will be waiting.maggie kicks her shoes off, slips the spare clip into her her cleavage. she takes the gun andslips up the stairs. she reaches the vip's table and the bodyguard promptly reacts, but maggie is faster and quickly puts a bullet in his chest;

she will be released from the compound the next day. calming downmaggie gives bob a sharp, semi-passionate kiss and says it's the last one she'll give him.maggie is being prepared for release. bob tells kaufman she's ready to be a field operative;

ocean view from the window and says she'll take the apartment.maggie's next task is buying herself groceries. she walks through the supermarket, pushing her cart a little aimlessly; clearly not sure how to go about picking up food. following another woman shopper's choices she loads her cart up with cans of canned ravioli, cantaloupes, a stack of packaged tv dinners, and half a dozen loaves of bread.j.p happens to be in the supermarket as well. when maggie drops a number of her ravioli cans while preparing to check out, he comes to help her place her groceries on the register counter. they make some small talk as the cashier begins ringing up the items. she boldly invites him to join her for dinner that evening.over dinner, j.p. tells maggie a little about himself; in return for managing the building and collecting rent checks for the landlord, he gets half off his own rent. in his spare time, he's working on building up a photography portfolio. maggie listens in rapt fascination, and suddenly takes a piece of ravioli in her mouth and playfully approaches j.p., inviting him to bite off the half that's sticking out of her mouth. j.p. briefly hesitates but then follows through, and maggie begins to kiss him. they begin a relationship. he helps her fix up her apartment and takes a number of photographs of her.four months pass and j.p. finally has noticed that outside of him, maggie seems to know nobody in the neighborhood and has no friends or family. he realizes he doesn't know a lot about her life. maggie is agreeable to j.p. asking her some questions... but the ones he asks take her completely off-guard; questions that the cover identity prepared for her don't take into account. j.p. notes her reaction and walks away, a little upset. maggie goes up to him while he gazes out of her window, and finally tells him a little about her true self; her actual connection to artist nina simone-- who was not only her favorite musician, but also her mother's. maggie explains her love for the simple passion in nina simone's music, and how she plays it when she thinks about her mother.maggie is laying with j.p. in her bed one morning when her phone rings. she answers it, and hears a man on the other end address her as nina. she's being called to an operative assignment at the marriott hotel in century city and is expected at the personnel entrance in an hour. making up a cover story for j.p. about needing to hurry to el segundo to salvage the sale of 500 computer video cards, maggie dresses and heads out.at the marriott, maggie goes to the personnel entrance and makes her way to the room service office, where a man in a suit is seeing to the room service staff and two maids, who are tied to chairs and gagged and blindfolded. the man in charge hands maggie a maid's uniform and tells her to put it on. once she's dressed, she's told simply to wait.presently, the phone rings, and one of the operatives takes the call, posing as a member of the room service staff. he politely takes the service order and prints up a receipt, telling the caller that the order will take 15 minutes to arrive. the other operatives quickly set to work preparing glasses of orange juice, a bowl of cereal, several cups and kettles for coffee and tea. the lead operative carefully places a circular disc-shaped object into the base of the coffee pot. maggie is to bring the room service tray to its destination and then return.maggie delivers the room service tray, looking a little nervous as a man in a suit outside the doorway quickly frisks her to make sure she's unarmed. she brings the tray inside the suite where a number of men in suits make small talk. one of the security agents quickly checks the items on the tray, and then signs the receipt for maggie.maggie returns to the room service office, where the operatives are listening and recording all sounds from the suite through an eavesdropping device concealed in the room service tray. she gives the receipt booklet to the lead operative and asks what she needs to do now. shrugging and looking as though the answer should be obvious, he tells maggie that she is free to return home.changing back into her skirt suit and once again looking like a working professional, maggie leaves the hotel and smiles as she heads back to her car. as she prepares to start her car up-- a major, fiery explosion suddenly tears through the top floor of the hotel. maggie knows that she delivered the tray that not only concealed a listening device, but also must have concealed a high-power explosive.bob is waiting for her outside her building. everyone at headquarters, including kaufman, is pleased at her performance. headquarters knows she's met a man and is romantically involved with him... bob now needs to meet j.p. himself. over maggie's protests, he tells her that she needs to invite him to her home for dinner.bob arrives at maggie's house for the dinner with maggie and j.p., posing as maggie's uncle. during the meal, bob and j.p. do most of the talking; bob relaying carefully prepared answers about himself. j.p. asks bob a little about maggie, which infuriates her as she had managed to talk j.p. into neither of them talking a lot about their respective backgrounds. maggie angrily lashes out at j.p. and carelessly lets slip a detail about having come from the ghettos of kansas city-- despite her cover identity being about having come from chicago. bob defuses the situation by telling a gentle story about how maggie was born in kansas city. maggie gives a small smile as she listens to bob. bob tells j.p. that he is in the travel business, and is giving both of them a present-- tickets to new orleans for the mardi gras. maggie suspects that this is a cover to get her to new orleans where she will have a field assignment.maggie has some time to enjoy the festival with j.p., but as they head in search of a suitable bistro to get a meal, they are accosted by two men intent on robbing them. j.p. hands over some cash, but the men are not satisfied with anything less than everything they are carrying. maggie quickly lashes out, putting her training to use, subduing both assailants... and then having to explain to j.p., although he is impressed at how she handled herself. she calls room service for a meal but the happiness is cut short when the call for nina arrives. the caller tells her that the bathroom cabinet has a hidden compartment.maggie manages to excuse herself to take a bath, filling the tub as cover so she can search the cabinet. she finds a headset and walkie-talkie and sets them up. her caller tells her to look in the drawers under the sink, and she finds a high-power rifle with a sophisticated silencer barrel and scope, assembling them quickly and expertly. she's then directed to open her window, but there's no handle. she uses the bath at to muffle the sound of her breaking the glass. her caller directs her to aim at an approaching limousine, but he has to wait for further instructions while she is stalling for time with j.p., who has decided he wants to propose to her. maggie tries to stifle her tears. room service arrives which buys maggie a minute or two as j.p. takes the order and signs the receipt. but her caller still hasn't been identified who maggie's target is.as j.p. returns to trying to get maggie to answer him, she is finally told that her target is a woman in white. j.p. and maggie's caller are both unknowingly vying for her attention takes away from her focus and she struggles desperately for composure. finally she makes her shot just before j.p. finally opens the door and confronts maggie. he sees she's still in her shirt and panties, even though the tub is full, and he notices the broken window. tearfully, her voice a whisper, maggie finally confesses that long ago, she did something very bad, and although she came through it, she must spend the rest of her life paying a bitter price. j.p. is moved to compassion and comforts her, but when she begs him to understand that she has her reasons for being secretive, he says he'll take it 'for now.' she's hidden the rifle and radio in the bathtub.maggie confronts bob at the operation hq. she tells him she's had enough and wants out, but bob sternly rebuffs her, warning her that 'out' doesn't exist in their field. she tries to appeal to his sense of humanity, insisting that she is no longer the same cold-hearted murderer who he saved from execution.bob hands her a dossier on a wealthy man named fahd bahktiar (richard romanus), saying that the job needed is specifically what she was trained for; only a woman operative could hope to pull it off. the job entails impersonating his girlfriend to get onto his estate, then killing him and destroying his computer containing secret data on sensitive nuclear information he's peddling to the middle east... after she downloads it to discs to bring back.maggie goes to see amanda and asks whether amanda believes she would be capable of leaving the agency. amanda finally tells maggie that she doesn't know. maggie thanks her and leaves... dropping the dossier in a trash bin on her way out.back at maggie's home, she is taking out trash and finds bob outside. he's recovered the dossier and hands it back to her. relenting on his initial position, he quietly tells her that if she completes the job, he'll try to help her in return.maggie spends time with her assistant, beth (lorraine toussaint), researching fahd's girlfriend, angela (olivia d'abo), studying acquired tapes of a birthday party fahd threw for her, so maggie can properly impersonate her. as they are doing their work, j.p. arrives home. his reception of beth is completely cynical and sarcastic;"" he's figured out by now that bob is not maggie's uncle and that the black beth is not a relative.maggie and beth pose as stylists that are due to make up angela's hair and nails. on the terrace, they discreetly try to offer her some jasmine tea which has been drugged, but angela demurs, saying she doesn't drink tea. forced to improvise, maggie waits until angela puts her hands in beth's, then beth grips her hands to hold them while maggie covers angela's mouth and injects her with a knockout drug. unfortunately, before angela succumbs to the drug, her muffled cries alert her bodyguards and a gunfight breaks out. the two bodyguards are killed, but beth is hit and wounded. she calls kaufman to report in, and maggie is horrified to learn from beth that kaufman is calling in a cleaner.the cleaner, victor (harvey keitel) arrives. he puts the two guards, along with a security agent he killed getting into the building, into the hot tub and puts angela inside as well even though she's unconscious, and begins pouring strong acid into the tubs as part of 'clean-up.' beth, who knows that there were supposed to be no side casualties in the job, is horrified, but victor silences beth with a bullet to her heart. maggie, getting scared, knows that she can't afford any more screw-ups in finishing the job. she makes herself up as angela and victor drives her to fahd's.back at hq, kaufman is telling bob that a cleaner was brought in to make sure the problems that have already arisen in the operation, won't cause a backlash that implicates them. this also includes orders for victor that after maggie finishes the job, she must also be killed.maggie, disguised as angela, gains entrance to fahd's house, she goes to the bathroom where he is taking a bath, and pulls her gun, ordering him to go to his computer and bring up his nuclear program.bob is seen hurrying out of the hq building and into his car.maggie herds fahd into his study and makes him access his computer. when the monitor shows a system error, maggie suspects him of stalling and pushes him aside, entering a command to write to a floppy disk. but the disk drive is encrypted and requires a password. maggie threatens fahd by telling him to imagine what a bullet in the stomach would feel like, in order to get the password from him. putting a disk into the drive, she begins copying all the data.one of fahd's security agents tells victor that he cannot stay parked where he is and has to move his car. victor pretends to cooperate, but throws the car into reverse so that the agent is scooped up onto the trunk and tossed over a low fence to tumble down the steep hill that fahd's estate is located atop.maggie finishes copying the data and inserts a device into the computer's disk drive that fries all of the computer's circuits and the hard drive. she orders fahd on the ground, which fahd knows means she intends to kill him. maggie's hand shakes and fahd notices that she is struggling to carry out her orders. fahd's survival instincts kick in and he leaps up, tackling maggie to the ground and wrestling for control of her gun while he yells for his chief bodyguard.maggie manages to hit fahd in the head and then fights her way past several guards to leap into victor's waiting car. more guards converge, shooting, as the main gate closes to cut off exit. but victor drives off the main path to bust through a side fence, making it onto a road and escaping.maggie says she's through and has had enough... but as victor turns to look at her, she realizes that victor is planning to kill her as victor reaches for his gun, maggie bashes him with her purse and grabs the hand brake for the car, careening it out of control and leaving it half perched on a bend in the road over a steep incline. victor hits maggie in her face, knocking her out of the car. he leaps down after her and they fight. maggie crawls into a shallow space between the car and the ground, and victor tries to get at her with a knife. when victor braces himself by grabbing onto the underside of the car, maggie lashes out with her boot and the car tips further over the edge of the road, pinning victor underneath it and partially crushing him. maggie tries to crawl out sideways from the shallow space protecting her, but victor manages to grab her by her throat. they struggle until the car finally slides over the edge of the road, breaking victor's grip and crushing him completely as it slides all the way down the incline, taking him with it.bob arrives on the scene as a fire crew is on the scene. they show him where victor's car is, but there's no sign of maggie.maggie has managed to make it back home and takes a shower. she goes to her bed, finding j.p. seemingly asleep, but she can tell by his breathing that he's awake. j.p. sits up and is horrified on seeing that maggie is bruised and banged up. he kisses her lightly and gives her a hug.bob arrives at maggie's home and is let in by j.p., whose reaction at the sight of bob shows that he understands more about his true connection to maggie than bob would care for. j.p. shows bob that maggie has left home and taken none of her personal belongings with her, not even her purse-- nothing but the clothes on her back... and j.p. understands some of the reasons why. j.p. asks bob to just let maggie go. when bob says he can't, j.p. hands him the disk maggie was supposed to get for him-- she'd left it with j.p. to give to bob. bob picks up one of maggie's nina simone records and asks if he can take it with him.as bob starts to drive off, maggie is seen watching from further down a side street. shivering briefly, she starts to walk down the street. as she walks, bob suddenly pulls back and looks intently at her. he calls kaufman on his mobile phone. he says there was a bad car wreck last night, and victor is dead, but all the information they needed was salvaged. bob seems to struggle for a long moment, but finally tells kaufman that maggie is dead as well.maggie half turns and notices bob's car driving off. she knows that he spotted her and recognized her and has left her alone.""",cult

404,Les tontons flingueurs,"""a public works plant in montauban, in the south-east of france. late in the evening, the boss, fernand naudin (lino ventura), takes his car to go to paris on some urgent matter. which bothers his assistant because of the annual fair on the next week-end.early in the morning, fernand arrives in paris on the champs-elysées, to meet his old friend, louis (jacques dumesnil), who just came back from mexico, where he had gone fifteen years before, to get away from french justice. they remained very close friends, even after fernand change to legal business. the meeting place is a bowling alley, where fernand is met by another friend of louis, henri (paul mercey), the manager of the place.in an apartment above the bowling alley, louis is lying in bed, where a doctor is giving him a shot. after the doctor is gone, louis explains fernand that he is very ill, and that he came back to france do die and be buried next to his parents. he also tells fernand about his 18-year old daughter, patricia, whose mother was a hooker friend of him, and whom he would like fernand to take care of after his death. money is no problem, since louis has several not quite legal business, but which work very smoothly, and which get enough money for patricia's needs. nevertheless fernand is not very happy about the idea.their heated conversation is stopped by the arrival of louis' assistants, raoul (bertrand blier) and paul (jean lefebvre) volfoni, who run a clandestine and illegal roulette on a barge, and théo (horst frank), who runs an illegal distillery. théo, who is homosexual, has come with his boyfriend, vincent (georges nojaroff), whom louis doesn't want to be present. louis tells the three remaining men that fernand is now in charge of his business, which doesn't seem to please raoul volfoni. but pascal (valentino venantini), louis' gunman, being around, neither the volfoni brothers nor théo don't say much about it.after they're gone, fernand remains alone with louis. when louis has an attack, fernand calls pascal to help him and louis dies in both men's arms.after louis' death, fernand goes back in the bowling alley, where henri gets him something to eat. the volfoni brothers try to talk fernand out of taking over louis' business, but fernand refuses not to keep a promise made to a dying friend. their conversation is interrupted by a phone call from tomate, who runs a illegal roulette in a farm. tomate seems to have some problem with nervous patrons. pascal wants to have a look and fernand asks him to go with him. after their departure, théo, who, unlike the volfoni, didn't say a word to fernand, tells vincent, his boyfriend, that he has just taken care of fernand as a problem.pascal and fernand reach the farm, but they've just left their car when they get machine-gunned from a gunman in a big american car. pascal kills both the gunman and the driver, and then goes inside the farm, followed by a slightly disturbed fernand, who wonders if the volfoni are not the sponsors of the dead gunman. pascal agrees with him.tomate (charles régnier), alone in the roulette room, seems very surprised by what pascal and fernand tell him. he sends his henchman, freddy (henri cogan), to clean the mess made by the gun fight, and then he explains to fernand that he had no problem that evening in the roulette room, and consequently that he never phoned the bowling alley. but when fernand phones the bowling alley, he learns that henri has been shot and killed, and that the police is already there.pascal drives fernand to the 18th century manor that louis had bought for his daughter, who lives there with her two «uncles», folace (francis blanche), who is a shady attorney in charge of louis' business, and jean (robert dalban), who is a former burglar, adopted by louis, and converted into a butler. pascal goes back home and folace explains to fernand that patricia is a bit of a problem, because she consistently gets kicked out of every private school she goes to. fernand, who wants to get back to montauban as soon as possible, tells folace that he is going to make patricia understand how she must behave. folace also tells jean and fernand that patricia must never know that her father, whom she knows only through his letters, is dead.next morning, fernand is shaving when patricia (sabine sinjen) enters the bathroom. she teases fernand, whom her father, in his letters, describes as some sort of modern knight. when fernand tells her they must have a serious conversation, she gets away.a bit later, folace tells fernand that louis' business is not running as smoothly as he thought, and even less since louis' «assistants» learned about his death.fernand then meets patricia's fiancé, antoine delafoy (claude rich), a musical genius or so he pretends himself to be ! actually he is a very smart young man, a bit eccentric, and who keeps on talking all the time, to fernand's obvious annoyance.pascal discreetly interrupts fernand's conversation with antoine, to tell him that louis' «assistants» are holding a secret meeting on the volfoni's barge. fernand feels like going to see what it's all about, along with the very efficient pascal. antoine doesn't believe in fernand's unexpected board meeting, and thinks fernand is going to meet some girl !around the roulette table inside the barge, are gathered the volfoni brothers, théo, vincent, tomate, freddy, and madame mado (dominique davray) who runs an illegal brothel. raoul is trying to get them to do something about the situation, but théo objects that, since louis' death, there have been too many murders around.on the barge deck, fernand, pascal and folace are met by léo, who is the barge «official» skipper. when léo says he wants to ask the volfoni before letting his visitors inside the barge, fernand punches him and sends him into the river.in the roulette room, the meeting is very heated, when someone knocks at the door. freddy opens the door and gets fernand's fist in his face. pascal walks in behind fernand with a gun in each hand. bastien (marc ronay), volfoni's gunman, wants to react, but raoul stops him.fernand sits down, and, with the help of folace, goes on with important matters. he asks mado about the irregular management of her brothel. she defends her business with quite a sense of humor. fernand turns to théo, who talks about his problems with illegal alcohol.meanwhile, in a small room near the entrance of the roulette room, the two gunmen, pascal and bastien, are talking shop and showing each other's guns.after théo's, fernand opens the volfoni's file. he explains he has decided to make their bookkeeping much easier : he will just ask them to pay this year what they paid the year before. he then asks pascal to come and get their money during the coming week.fernand and friends leave the room with bastien. after they've gone, mado makes fun of raoul, whom she finds a bit of a coward. raoul gets very angry when she says that. then someone knocks at the door and he crosses the room to open it. he gets fernand's fist in his face. fernand tells him that he gives him an extra ten percent on his debt because of the delay.back to the manor, fernand finds patricia and antoine seated close to each other on a sofa, listening to corelli in the dark. he sends patricia to her room and antoine out of the house.later in the evening, fernand is listening to the corelli record while eating some chicken, when pascal and bastien enter discreetly through a french window. the two gunmen explain to fernand that they've found they are related, and the dispute between fernand and the volfoni is giving them a moral dilemma. they are afraid that, one day, they will have to face each other, guns in hand. so bastien has just resigned his job with the volfoni and pascal is doing the same with fernand.a few days later, fernand is reading a dissertation patricia wrote about corneille, racine, bossuet and pascal. he finds it so good that he thinks that the teacher could have given her a higher grade. he is interrupted by a call from one of his assistants in montauban.a few moments later, folace explains to fernand that the expected money didn't come in when he gets interrupted by a call from raoul, who tells him there are some problem at the distillery.at the distillery, tomate asks théo if he thinks fernand believed what they suggested the too naïve raoul to tell him. the answer is the noise made by fernand's car arriving at the distillery. théo explains to tomate and freddy that, after they get rid of fernand, they will just have to get also rid of the volfoni brothers, and then they will be the only bosses of the late louis' business.after he has sent his assistants on their duties, théo greets fernand with a feigned surprise. he explains to fernand that his problem is that he just lost the driver who was supposed to drive a truck full of moonshine (illegal alcohol), and because he, théo, doesn't have a driver's license anymore, he asked raoul to get him a new driver. fernand tells him he is going to drive the truck himself.to reach the «meeting place», fernand has to cross the fontainebleau forest. this is where théo and tomate are waiting for him with a machine-gun. they shoot the truck, which gets off the road, and then starts burning. fernand succeeds in leaving the truck, and with a burned and torn suit, he reaches the volfoni barge.there, he knocks raoul out, and then empty the open safe. paul volfoni, who does not understand a word of what fernand tells him about trucks and moonshine, nevertheless lets the very angry fernand takes the money out of the safe.when fernand gets back at the manor with his bag full of money, it is to find that his «niece» patricia is having a party where she invited a lot of young idle «bourgeois». many sport cars are parked in front of the manor. when one of the owners of one of these sport cars says something quite inappropriate about the relationship between patricia and antoine, fernand feels he has to give the young guy a good thrashing.he then enters the manor, where all the young guests are dancing while jean is moving around them with a tray full of drinks. fernand has a little chat with patricia, and then goes to the kitchen.in the kitchen, folace is buttering toasts for the guests. fernand shows him the money inside the bag. when jean sees fernand torn suit, and when fernand tells him it is the work of the volfoni, jean puts a gun in his pocket.a quite useful decision when, a few minutes later, the volfoni brothers enter the manor. jean guide them to the kitchen, where they get in, gun in hand. jean comes in behind them, pointing his own gun in their backs, and he asks them to give him their guns. paul, to calm the situation down, start buttering the toasts. a very drunk girl enters the kitchen, because she is looking for a drink. when she takes some money in the bag to buy drinks, folace is so aggressive with her that she goes out very quickly.raoul says he would like very much to share a drink with his friends, but folace tells him that the kid have drunk everything in the house, and that the only bottle left is an old bottle of moonshine whisky. even those tough men find it a bit strange to drink, and get drunk very quickly.meanwhile, antoine is telling patricia he feels like telling «uncle fernand» about their love.back in the kitchen, all the men are completely drunk. raoul feels like visiting the bathroom very urgently, and rushes out of the kitchen.when raoul goes out of the bathroom, he feels better, even though he is still drunk, and he starts flirting with patricia, offering to give her a «job» in egypt. patricia knows very well what kind of a job he means, but antoine doesn't find it very funny.back in the kitchen, raoul tells fernand about the «inappropriate» jealousy of antoine, and fernand decides it is time to close the shop.helped by the volfoni brothers and folace, fernand kicks all the guests out of the house. the men are so excited by their job that they even kick paul volfoni out, which makes them laugh a lot. but they stop laughing when they see patricia crying on the staircase.next morning, folace wakes up fernand to tell him that patricia has gone away during the night with her suitcase. fortunately, jean wrote down the license plate of the taxicab who took her away.the cab driver brings fernand to antoine's apartment. when fernand walks in the living-room, antoine is experimenting «musique concrète» (concrete music). he doesn't seem to appreciate fernand interrupting him. but patricia calms fernand down when she walks in from the kitchen. she tells her «uncle» she is going to marry antoine. fernand likes the idea better when she tells him that antoine's father is vice-president of the international monetary fund.two or three days later, it is fernand's birthday. early in the morning, patricia, jean and folace give him a present each. patricia adds a present brought in very early from the volfoni brothers. when fernand hears a threatening tick-tock coming from the parcel, he throws it through the open window, and the parcel explodes in the garden. we can see théo and vincent walking discreetly away.fernand goes to the volfoni's barge, and, when raoul opens the door, fernand sings «happy birthday» and then punches raoul violently on the nose. after his departure, raoul fixes a small bomb to get his own back on fernand.during the night, fernand hears a strange noise and puts a gun in his night-robe pocket.meanwhile in the garage, raoul is putting his bomb inside fernand's car. he sends his brother away to check on the surroundings, and after paul's departure, fernand walks discreetly in the garage.after fernand has «taken care» of raoul, we find the latter in an hospital room, covered with bandages and plaster casts.fernand's «accident» with the truck full of moonshine is in the newspapers' front page. but pascal and bastien tells fernand it was wrong of him to think it was the volfoni's fault. they explain that, if the volfoni had decided to kill fernand or henri, the first person they would have asked to do it would have been bastien, their official gunman. pascal thinks the whole business comes from théo. fernand asks pascal and bastien to go and have a friendly chat with théo.in the distlllery, pascal and bastien do not find théo, but only tomate. they make him talk and then kill him. when he finds tomate's body, théo understands he is next on their list, and he decides to take care of fernand before fernand takes care of him.théo, vincent and freddy try to storm the manor, but folace, jean and fernand don't let them do it and fight back. in the middle of a gunfight that looks like something out of a western movie, amédée delafoy (pierre bertin), antoine's father, crosses the park to ask «uncle fernand» the hand of his «niece» patricia for his son. the gunfight goes on, but, because amédée is deaf as a doorpost, he doesn't hear a thing ! he begins to have a feeling that something may be wrong when a bullet hits the ceiling above him and he gets covered with plaster ! the gunfight stops with the arrival of pascal and bastien. théo thinks that, with two marksmen on the other side, the fight is not fair anymore.to take his own back for his defeat, théo waits for raoul coming out of the hospital along with his brother, and shoots them. both raoul and paul volfoni are back in an hospital room, both covered with bandages and plaster casts !a few days later, fernand is getting his «niece» married. he is wearing a frock coat and has a quiet chat with the bridegroom, antoine, when pascal comes in discreetly to warn him that théo is leaving the distillery with his friends. fernand asks jean and folace to take care of the guests while he is going to take care of théo with pascal and bastien, who is waiting for them at the distillery.at the distillery, théo and freddy are sorting out important or incriminating documents, which théo puts inside a bag. when vincent comes in to tell them about fernand's arrival, they take their weapons to give fernand a warm welcome.the first to die is vincent, burned to death by a jerry can full of gasoline, set on fire by bastien. next comes freddy, who, after a long fistfight with fernand, breaks through a brick wall on the first floor of the building down to the ground.théo succeeds in escaping with his car. but pascal prevents fernand from running after him, because it is almost wedding time. pascal and bastien help fernand to fix his frock coat, a bit torn during the fight, and bring him in front of the church just when folace was starting to think he would never see him.while the service is going on inside the church, théo parks in front of the church, and gets his machine-gun ready for fernand and guests when they walk out of the church.inside the church, every one is listening to the organ and choral music, when they hear a loud blast coming from outside the church. they all turn their heads toward the door, through which pascal and bastien walk in very quietly, and make a respectful sign of the cross.the last scene of the film shows théo's car burning in front of the church with théo inside the

not concur with hunter, the xo orders ramsey to be arrested and locked in his cabin. a hesitant chief of the boat concurs with the xo and has the captain detained. hunter assumes command and informs the crew that they will still patrol, at the same state of readiness, and attempt to re-establish communications to verify the eam.on sonar, the akula reappears and attacks, launching torpedoes. hunter orders an evasion plan and the alabama avoids being hit. hunter launches two more torpedoes which connect with their target and destroy the akula. however, a last torpedo was launched by the akula before it was destroyed and explodes very close to the alabama. propulsion is damaged and the bilge bay takes on water despite the efforts of several crew members to contain it. the men in the bilge bay drown when hunter orders the bilge bay sealed. meanwhile, the alabama is sinking rapidly, approaching a depth of 1850 feet, where the intense water pressure will crush the hull. propulsion is restored before the boat can be destroyed and the boat rises to a safe depth.several of ramsey's officers decide that hunter is unfit for command and they plot a counter-mutiny to free ramsey. they persuade weps to join them and give them the key to the weapons locker to take the sub back by force. they free ramsey, who follows the armed men back to the bridge where they arrest hunter and the other officers who aided him in the mutiny. ramsey assumes command and order the launch to continue. while in detention, hunter talks philosophically about the choice to launch nuclear missiles and start the destruction of the world.rivetti, while walking between cabins, is stopped by the same man he fought with earlier. rivetti is able to overpower the larger man and free hunter and the other arrested officers. they make their way back to the bridge to stop ramsey from launching. after a tense altercation in the weapons cabin which delays ramsey long enough for hunter to seize the master missile key, the two face off on the bridge. ramsey hits hunter in the face twice, demanding his missile key back. communications reports that the radio is very close to being operational. ramsey allows three minutes for the radio to operate again and receive another eam. the two sit in the command center, awaiting the message. while they do, ramsey lights a cigar and brings up the subject of horse riding again, saying that lipizzaner stallions are from portugal. hunter tells the captain they're spanish horses, born with a black color and turn white later in life. ramsey still insists they're from portugal.rivetti reports that the eam transmitter is fixed and that a new eam is coming in. it's brought to the bridge and authenticated. when authenticated, the message is for the alabama to stand down and cancel the launch of their missiles. ramsey retires himself from the bridge and is saluted as he walks to his cabin.in pearl harbor, hawaii, a general inquiry is called before the pacific fleet admiral (jason robards). having reviewed the incident, he tells both hunter and ramsey that they both were right and wrong in their actions aboard the alabama. off the record, he admonishes both of them, saying they've done much to disrupt the traditional chain of command of the navy. the admiral also announces, to hunter's surprise, that ramsey has filed for retirement. hunter is further astonished when he hears that he is to be given a captain's commission aboard another submarine and that he came highly recommended by ramsey himself.outside navy hq, ramsey is retrieving his dog from an ensign. he sees hunter and tells him that he was right, about the lipizzaner stallions being from spain. the two smile and salute each other.""",cult
281,Outland,"""set in the distant future, federal marshal william t. o'niel (sean connery), is assigned to a one-year tour of duty at con am 27, a titanium ore mining outpost on jupiter's third moon io (pronounced """"""""eye-oh""""""""), a volcanic moon about 2,275 miles in diameter and located 275,000 miles from jupiter's gas surface. conditions on io are difficult - gravity is 1/6th that of earth with no breathable atmosphere, atmospheric work-suits are cumbersome, and miners carry around their own air supply whilst working. shifts are long but significant bonuses are paid as incentives to boost production. explaining in an opening disclaimer, con am 27 is franchised to con-amalgamate by the league of industrial nations located on earth. the colony's population is 2,144 men and women (1,250 labor, 714 support personnel, and 180 administration and maintenance crew). it is policed by a forced called administrative level 4 and above.mark sheppard (peter boyle), the head of the mining colony, boasts that since he took over the running of io productivity has broken all previous records.the film begins with a miner named tarlow (john ratzenberger) suffering an attack of the dt's who rips open his work-suit which then decompresses resulting in his death. shortly thereafter another miner cane (eugene lipinski) enters a lift to the mine without wearing his work-suit, and likewise dies from decompression.with the assistance of dr. lazarus (frances sternhagen), o'niel starts an investigation into these deaths. however, before he can complete his investigation there is a further incident, this time involving a worker sagan (steven berkoff) threatening to kill a prostitute with a knife. at the scene of this incident o'niel attempts to calm the man and enter the room by the main door, whilst montone, o'niel's sergeant (james b. sikking), enters the room via the air duct. montone shoots sagan dead before o'niel can talk with him.o'niel takes a sample of blood from the dead sagan in the morgue and has lazarus examine it in her lab. it is here where they both discover the one thing all the deaths have in common that all of the miners had a lethal amphetamine-type drug, called """"""""polydichloric euthimal"""""""" in their bloodstream. the drug allows the miners to work continuously for days at a time until they become """"""""burned out"""""""" and turn psychotic. o'niel uncovers a drug ring to distribute these drugs to the miners, run by sheppard and effectively sanctioned by montone.o'niel confronts sheppard, but the administrator smugly informs him that nobody else wants the drug shipments stopped"";"" production is up, the workers are happy, the corporate owners (consolidated amalgamated) are also happy, therefore sheppard is happy. o'niel vows to expose the entire scheme.meanwhile, o'niel's wife (kika markham), frustrated that he considers justice more important than his family, leaves him a message pleading with him to return with her to earth.by the use of surveillance cameras, o'niel pursues and captures one of sheppard's drug dealers and places him in isolation. however, before he can be questioned by o'niel the dealer is killed. montone is then found garroted in his quarters. o'niel does however manage to obtain, and destroy, the latest consignment of drugs which has been hidden in a food shipment recently arrived from the jupiter space station. when sheppard is informed of this, he contacts his company rep aboard the orbiting space station about 70 hours away from io and informs him of the situation and summons two professional hitmen to kill o'niel, but his message is monitored by o'niel. sheppard also tells his unseen contact that he has an """"""""inside man"""""""" also ready to kill o'niel if need be. the company rep warns sheppard that if his men fail to kill o'niel, the next assassins the company sends will be coming after sheppard.at this point, the film evolves into a 'high noon' situation as o'niel waits during the 70 hours it takes from the shuttle to travel from the space station to arrive at con am 27. the fact that the shuttle is bearing professional assassins is spread around the facility, and o'niel's attempts to defend himself by organising resistance fall on deaf ears as no-one is prepared to risk their lives to help him. aware that he may not survive, o'niel last's act is to send a message to his wife and son (who left him early in the film) that he will join them on their trip home to earth.the shuttle arrives about 42 minutes early. over the surveillance cameras, o'niel sees the two assassins, armed with high-tech rapid firing shotguns, separate from the rest of the miners and go hunting for o'niel. with the sole assistance of dr. lazarus, o'niel engages in a desperate kill-or-be-killed chase through the colony before dispatching the assassins. after being wounded in an ambush by one of the assassins. o'niel dons a space suit and goes out and kills one of the assassins when dr. lazarus traps him in an umbilicus corridor and o'niel depressurizes it to kill the assassin.o'niel dispatches the next assassin who enters the colony's greenhouse and tricks him into shooting at a falling object outside the glass where the greenhouse depressurizes after one of its windows is shot out and the assassin is swept out by the vacuum to his death.but while still outside, o'niel comes face-to-face with the last assassin: his very own deputy ballard (clarke peters), armed with a shotgun, who follows him out and attempts to kill him. o'niel runs where he turns the tables on his traitorous deputy and engages in hand-to-hand combat after he disarms him. o'niel pulls out an oxygen tube to the assassin's spacesuit and the deputy too dies from depressurization.afterwords, a wounded and exhausted o'niel confronts sheppard in the outpost's bar where all the other colony employees have gathered and punches him out. arrest warrants are issued for all those involved in the drug smuggling operation, including sheppard. after this, o'niel's tour of duty is complete and he retires, accompanying his family back on earth.""",cult
314,Red Dawn,"""""""""""red dawn"""""""" envisions an alternate history of mid-1980's america. a few title cards that precede the opening credits tell of famine in the soviet union, leading to food riots in poland. the ussr subsequently invades poland. troubles in central america include cuba and nicaragua building their armies to immense, unprecedented numbers and invade the nations of el salvador and honduras. a communist revolution breaks out in mexico. in europe, political divisions in the north atlantic treaty organization (nato) lead to the dismantling of nuclear weapons. finally, nato dissolves, leaving the united states with no allies or support.the story is set in a small colorado mountain town called calumet. before an autumn school day in september a young man named jed eckert (patrick swayze) is dropping his younger brother matt (charlie sheen) and their friend arturo (doug toby) off at school. while giving a lecture on genghis khan's tactics in conquering asia, their history teacher notices paratroopers landing outside in the school football field. thinking they may be american soldiers who are off course, he leaves the classroom to investigate and is immediately shot and killed by one of the soldiers, who then open fire on the classroom, killing at least one student. matt and arturo (""""""""aardvark"""""""") escape the chaos when jed pulls up, having quickly returned. they are also joined by their friends daryl (darren dalton), robert (c. thomas howell), and danny (brad savage) . they drive through town, witnessing more of the invasion. arturo's father is seen being chased by the invaders and tries to reach them but is apprehended.the group drives out of town to robert's father's wilderness store. robert's father tells them to grab supplies for camping and gives them a few rifles and ammunition. they escape to the mountains""; jed's plan is to camp out there until the conflict is over. back in calumet, a cuban colonel named bella (ron o'neal) oversees the hasty occupation of the town. american forces have moved in from all sides and are attacking relentlessly. bella orders his cuban and nicaraguan troops to defensive positions and orders another of his men, a russian kgb agent, to acquire documents identifying local citizens who have privately-owned firearms.the boys arrive in the mountains and set up camp. an argument erupts between jed and the high school class president, daryl (the calumet's mayor's son), who insists they group go back and turn themselves in. jed orders him to leave, however, daryl relents and stays with the group. the group also discovers that their radio has been destroyed, so their contact with the outside world is essentially cut off. while hunting deer, robert makes a kill and drinks some of the deer's blood as part of a ritual that jed, his brother & their father all took part in. jed also suggests that everyone will notice a change in robert from then on.a few weeks later in october, jed, matt, and robert slip into calumet to find out what has happened in their absence. they talk to a store owner, named alicia, who tells them that the russians know who they are and tells them that the boys are being blamed for a series of crimes in the town. she also tells them that many people have been remanded to a holding camp at the town drive-in theater. the boys go to the camp that evening and find that it's a communist re-education camp. jed and matt's father (harry dean stanton) is a prisoner;"" when they see him, he has been severely beaten. telling his sons that he was hard on them for an occurrence like this, he also implores them to avenge him.the next morning, the group next goes to the ranch of their father's friend, mr. mason (ben johnson), who's property lies far enough outside calumet to go unnoticed. mason informs the boys that a large portion of the western united states has been occupied by soviet and cuban forces and they are all 40 miles behind enemy lines. beyond the soviet/cuban front lies """"""""fa"""""""" or """"""""free america."""""""" they also tell robert that his father was killed by the enemy"";"" while gathering their supplies at his father's store before fleeing to the mountains, the group also took several rifles. the soviet authorities had robert's father publicly executed for providing insurgents (the boys) with weapons. mason doesn't know what happened to robert's mother. robert breaks down and a distressed jed feels obvious guilt for their deaths. mason tells the boys that they are not at fault and that the lesson learned from the incident (symbolizing that of us government registration of privately-owned firearms) should sink in to them all. before they leave, mason gives them a radio and also asks that the boys take his teenage granddaughters with them, which they do. the two new additions are toni (jennifer grey) and her sister erica (lea thompson).meanwhile, daryl's father, calumet's mayor, bates (lane smith), a collaborationist of sorts, tries to appease the occupation authorities under colonel bella. he offers his assistance in getting the citizens of his town to adhere to the new laws that bella imposes.back in the woods, the group hears a radio announcement from the free zone that tells them the war is far from over (""""""""john has a long mustache"""""""") and the combat is at a standstill (""""""""the chair is against the wall""""""""). the next day, the group sees a russian patrol of three soldiers headed toward their position. while taking in the sites, the patrol sees the group and attempts to arrest them. jed, robert & the others kill them all. robert later talks of his enjoyment in killing them, probably seeking revenge for the deaths of his parents. jed remarks that they cannot return to town ever again because they'll be hunted.in reprisal, colonel bella orders the killing of several of the town's residents after they dig graves for the dead soviets. a mass execution takes place, one that matt witnesses from a distance. among those killed are his and arturo's fathers. also present is daryl's father, who is visibly sickened. jed later tells everyone not to cry over their families deaths.in retaliation, the teens continue their guerrilla campaign, dubbing themselves """"""""wolverines"""""""" after their high school football team's mascot. they ambush soviet and cuban patrols, shoot up armored columns, and raid local armories to steal weapons such as ak-47 rifles, sniper rifles, land mines, rpg launchers, among many other weapons.a month later, erica, while on patrol, sees a pilot land nearby by parachute. the pilot is an air force colonel, named andy tanner (powers boothe), who joins the team and fills them in on the events of the war. the occupying forces are made up of cuban and soviet commando forces who invaded from both mexico and canada. the soviet forces crossed into alaska (cutting the alaska oil pipeline). tactical nuclear weapons were used to take out key u.s. nuclear missile and communication locations however, by this time the front lines of combat have mostly stabilized. tanner tells the teens that the united states' only allies are great britain, who are suffering huge defeats, and about 600 million chinese. when daryl says that china's population is supposed to be over one billion, tanner implies that they've been defeated by the soviets as well, perhaps by mass slaughter in combat or by nuclear weapons.the team invites the colonel to join their guerrilla efforts. tanner also teaches them basic tactics for attacking larger targets"";"" they attack an airbase located near the re-education camp. they free the prisoners and destroy a few key military targets. tanner later notices robert carving hash marks into the stock of his ak-47 rifle for every enemy soldier he kills. tanner tells the boy that """"""""all that killing is gonna burn you up inside."""""""" robert replies, """"""""yeah, but it keeps me warm.""""""""jed takes tanner to meet mr. mason where he tells them both that there are rumors of the soviets dropping special forces units into the occupied zone to hunt the wolverines. there is also talk of sending in american special forces troops to aide them. jed believes their only chance to survive the war is to cross the front lines into free america. tanner decides to show them the way out of the occupied territory.they go to the front lines of combat where an m1 abrams american tank is engaged in a fierce battle with a few soviet t-62 tanks. tanner tells jed that they'll have to cross the no-man's land between the tanks to reach the free zone where soviet jets are dropping napalm. as they prepare to move forward, another soviet tank moves up to their position, unaware that tanner and the team are nearby. the tank begins to fire on the american tank and tanner sees an opportunity to disable the enemy. in the skirmish, arturo is killed and tanner is critically wounded by a grenade. before he succumbs to his injuries, he is able to mark the tank with a colored smoke bomb, making it visible to the american forces. they destroy the tank and tanner along with it. back in camp, erica becomes deeply depressed over his loss, having been attracted to him. a small funeral is held for tanner and arturo. their names are carved by the team into a nearby rock as a memorial.meanwhile, colonel bella and his superior, the russian cossack major general bratchenko (vladek sheybal), call in a soviet special forces team to hunt the wolverines. before they move in, their commander, major strelnikov (william smith), orders the forces in the area to cease their reprisals and atrocities against the local population, saying terror tactics like those will not win the conflict for them in the long term.the soviet commandos move into the mountains, using a tracking device to find the wolverines, however, the teens are waiting for them and kill most of the commandos. one is left alive and is interrogated by the group. they discover the tracking device, which reveals that the daryl is a traitor, having gone to town to see his father despite jed's strictest orders. while there, he had been forced to swallow a tracing bug and reveal his and his friends' location in the mountains. the team makes a tough decision to execute both daryl and the soviet prisoner. jed, enraged by the soviet invasion, kills the soldier and turns his gun on daryl, but is unable to kill him. robert steps up and very coldly and casually shoots daryl, leaving the team horrified at his callousness in executing a friend.by march of the following year, after five months of fighting, the wolverines are physically and emotionaly weakened, however, by the attacks and other events, and their morale erodes as the war of attrition continues. even though the american civilians are increasingly resistant to soviet rule, the occupation forces are pushing the resistance of the wolverines to the breaking point.a few days later, while observing a small detachment of soviet vehicles, jed notices that they drop a few cartons of food and calls off their attack. they scrounge what's there and take it back to their camp. however, the food has somehow been bugged and three heavily armed soviet mi-24 hind helicopters move in and attack the group. toni is shot immediately and is taken to cover by jed. the rest of the group also makes it to cover, however, robert's horse is shot out from under him. he makes a final stand, damaging one chopper with an rpg, killing the door gunner, and firing his rifle at a second. he is killed in a hail of gunfire. jed and the seriously wounded toni share a final moment and jed leaves her a grenade. later, when the soviets find her dead body, the grenade has been left live under her and goes off, taking at least one russian soldier with it.jed adds toni's and robert's names to those already on the memorial rock. tired and demoralized by the loss of their friends, jed and matt prepare an suicidal attack on the soviet headquarters in calumet itself which will serve as a diversion allowing erica and danny to escape to free america. during the climatic final battle, many soviet, cuban, and enemy soldiers and officers are killed during the fighting. jed and matt kill bratchenko and blow up his communications trailer with rpg's. while trying to escape on a nearby train, matt is shot by the pursuing strelnikov. jed sneaks up on strelnikov and the two shoot each other simultaneously at close range. strelnikov is killed and jed is wounded in his side. colonel bella sees jed holding his brother, but does not shoot them and lets him pass. jed takes his fatally wounded brother to a bench in the town's empty, snowy park square and cradles him as he dies. jed refuses to leave matt behind and stays, holding his dead brother while waiting for the soviet troops to find and finish him off. at the same time, bella, equally war weary and hoping to leave the prolonged conflict, returns to his headquarters and finishes writing out a letter of resignation from the cuban army.the film closes with erica and danny being the only two survivors of the original team. they make their way to free america territory in the great plains. erica narrates the final scene of the film, saying that the war continues with no end in sight, and that memorial to their friends is called """"""""partisan rock"""""""" and has an inscription that invokes the words of abraham lincoln's gettysburg address.the plaque reads: """"""""in the early days of world war iii, guerrillas - mostly children - placed the names of their lost upon this rock. they fought here alone and gave up their lives, so

(eileen davidson) interrupts and asks katie to stay for a big going away party at the house. katie agrees with a little more goading. meanwhile, mrs. slater has a hushed discussion with dr. beck. it seems she's still having trouble dealing with that night. dr. beck begs her to stay at the hospital, but she refuses. she wants to stay at her house (the sorority house) by herself for the summer. she threatens to expose """"""""what he did that night"""""""" if he tries to stop her. he gives her a medical alert bracelet and lets her go. back at the house, six of the sorority sisters, katie, liz, jeanie, diane, stevie and morgan, are all getting drunk and talking about boys and their future plans. mrs. slater comes home and catches them. she tells them all to get out by tomorrow morning. depressed, she heads up to the toy-filled attic as the girls discuss why the house always closes on june 19th instead while every other sorority/frat house stays open on graduation weekend. diane

start having sex in vicki's room. mrs. slater overhears and bursts in on them, violently using her cane to rip up vicki's waterbed. the next morning, by the pool, vicki convinces the others to go along with a revenge prank on mrs. slater. katie thinks the idea is stupid, but she's outvoted. as the girls come up with a plot, katie gets distracted by the attic windows closing. dr. beck examines mrs. slater's latest x-rays and says that she's nearing a psychotic breakdown due to the traumatic events of twenty years ago. he says that she has to be hospitalized before some """"""""traumatic

confronts her and tells her to look out by the pool for her cane.outside, mrs. slater finds her cane floating on a tire in the middle of the swimming pool. vicki pulls the gun on her and tells her to get in the pool. to reinforce her point, vicki takes a shot at a nearby lamppost. liz (janis ward) steps forward to object, but vicki accidentally shoots her in the leg. vicki tells them to stop being such pussies and forces mrs. slater back down into the pool. she fires the gun repeatedly at mrs. slater. nothing happens. mrs. slater looks up, puzzled. vicki and liz burst out in laughter. liz's """"""""injury"""""""" was just part of the show. furious, mrs. slater climbs out of the pool and smacks vicki in the head with her cane. the gun goes off and mrs. slater falls back into the water.

body to the bottom of the murky pool and dispose of the body in the morning. they wrap the body in a tarp and weigh it down, but what they don't see is the body popping up to the surface again after they've gone. later that night, the girls try to put on their best happy faces for the sorority party. everyone seems to be having a good time, talking about greek letters and failing courses. cut to mrs. slater's robe and the tarp thrown aside and someone has her cane. a drunken frat boy (ken myers) wanders through the forest and sees something he shouldn't see. the cane is rammed right through the throat. the drunk falls to his knees with blood spurting from his neck.all the girls are on edge at the party, though they try to hide it. then they hear a woman screaming out by the pool. they all run out there, but it's just a couple of frat boys trying to throw a girl into the pool. fearing that the body will be discovered, the girls convince the frat boys to leave her and check out the wet t-shirt contest. the frat boys throw her in anyway and then go to check out the contest. they pull her out of the water and stevie (ellen dorscher) realizes that the body will be seen if someone turns on the pool lights. stevie goes down to the cellar to see if she can't do something about the pool lights. someone grabs her from behind, forces her up against a wall and stabs her to death (all in the shadows).the band calls all the seniors up for a big dance. meanwhile, these three guys decide they want to go for a dip. one of the gets shoved in and another one turns on the lights. the girls see the lights go on and all run out, panicked that the body has been discovered. but the pool is empty except a fat frat boy. the girls meet in the kitchen to figure out what they're going to do about this. katie wants to go to the police. the other girls outvote her again and decide to search for mrs. slater's body, theorizing that she must have climbed out of the pool, but been unable to reach anyone before collapsing.the girls separate to go look for the body. morgan (jodi draigie) is sent upstairs to pack mrs. slater's clothes so it looks like she packed up and left. as she's collecting clothes, something falls out of the crawlspace onto her and she screams. but her screams are not loud enough for those downstairs at the party to hear her. it was mrs. slater's body, still wrapped in the tarp that fell on her. the girls check on morgan and wonder aloud how mrs. slater got all the way up there (but somehow don't wonder why she wrapped herself back up in the tarp after she walked up into the crawlspace). morgan goes to her room as the girls argue again. katie gets disgusted with all the arguing and goes to check on morgan. the other girls decide to dispose of the body again. morgan gets undressed and prepares for bed. morgan hears something at the window. she walks out on the balcony and finds a jack-in-the-box. she turns the crank until the little clown pops out. while distracted by this, the killer comes from behind her and shoves the pointy end of the cane right through her chest.cut to, the girls carrying the body outside and putting it in a dumpster, thinking it'll be a convenient way to hide the body while they get rid of it. katie, on the other hand, is concerned because she can't find morgan. she heads up into the attic and finds it filled with a child's toys. she finds a card that reads """"""""to eric, love mother."""""""" she pulls a curtain back and finds a life-size clown costume and mask that looks just like the one in the jack-in-the-box. peter (michael kuhn) sneaks up behind her and startles her. then he starts playing around with the toys. katie tells him to go get another drink and leave her alone. peter stands to leave and hits his head on a birdcage with a dead bird inside. outside, diane is waiting in the van for the other girls. she hears some noises and panics. she gets out and finds no one, so she gets back in the van. someone reaches through the sunroof and stabs her repeatedly with the cane.meanwhile, vicki, liz and jeanie (robin meloy) are pushing the dumpster down the road. a police car drives up and bumps into the dumpster. vicki sends jeanie back to the house before the officer sees her. the officer (ed heath) gets out and surveys the damage to his cruiser (not answering why he wasn't paying enough attention to the road to avoid a massive dumpster). he asks what they're doing out at one in the morning. they answer that they always take the trash out on friday nights. he is about to look in the dumpster when he gets a call on his radio to return to the station.jeanie reaches the house and has a near miss with the killer. in the fracas, mrs. slater's medic alert tag falls to the ground. jeanne reaches the house safely and finds katie. jeanie seems to be in shock because all she can say is """"""""cane."""""""" katie tells her to wait there and she'll be right back. jeanie grabs a chef's knife and waits. someone breaks the windowpane in the door, though, and unlatches the lock. jeanie runs upstairs into the bathroom and vomits. the killer follows her in and turns on the showers. jeanie tries to hide on a toilet stall, but the killer opens the stall and stabs her in the throat. katie is panicked when she can't find jeanie. she starts to call the police, but when peter offers to go get her house mother, katie realizes she can't call the police without spilling everything. she hangs up and asks peter to leave. peter takes it the wrong way and storms out. katie goes for a walk and finds mrs. slater's medic alert tag. she calls dr. beck and tells him the situation (not mentioning mrs. slater in the pool). dr. beck tells her to stay at the house and he'll be right over.when jeanie can't be found, vicki and liz take the body to the cemetery themselves. they find an empty plot and dig it down a little deeper, preparing to toss the body in. dr. beck arrives at the house and explains the whole story. mrs. slater wasn't able to conceive a child so she turned to him. he did some experimental and illegal procedures to help her conceive. katie asks him who """"""""eric"""""""" is. he says that mrs. slater has been celebrating her son's birthday as if he were still alive. he presses her about what happened to mrs. slater. katie looks out the window and sees someone floating in pool. she runs down and turns on the pool lights. it's diane. dr. beck calls the police and tells them to get to the sorority house. katie realizes that mrs. slater probably

401,Space Mutiny,"""set sometime in the distant future the intra-galactic space-colony-ship southern sun (which bears a strong resemblance to the battlestar galactica) is on a multi-generational trip to a new settlement. tired of his fate to live and die on the ship, kalgan (john philip law), the head of the enforcers who are tasked with the ship's security, causes an explosion in the southern sun's docking bay just as a fighter is landing there. the decorated fighter pilot, dave ryder (reb brown) survives the crash via an emergency teleportation system, but his passenger, professor spooner is killed in the the crash, which causes serious damage that puts the docking bay out of commission. ryder is taken to see the southern sun's commander, alex jansen (cameron mitchell), who accepts ryder's account of events, though his daughter lea (cisse cameron) flies into a rage at ryder and accuses him of abandoning the professor to die. despite this less than harmonious introduction, the two quickly become friends, and it becomes clear that lea is strongly attracted to ryder.just before the docking bay accident, a group of witchcraft-practising female aliens named bellerians are brought on-board. while they never interact with the main characters during the course of the film (aside from a brief scene in which their leader jennera consults with commander jansen), it is implied that they influence the actions of the lead protagonists, and also covertly help them by seducing enforcers, which causes kalgan to execute them for their seeming incompetence, thinning out his own forces.meanwhile, kalgan meets with his main co-conspirator macphearson (james ryan), the ship's chief engineer who feels unappreciated for his part in an incident in which he prevented a major disaster, but was severely injured and left unable to walk without aid. macphearson informs kalgan that it will be several weeks before any ship can land or take off from the southern sun, which will give kalgan and his forces time to take over the southern sun and force her to land"";"" to that end kalgan has also enlisted the aid of space pirates from the nearby corona borealis system. macphearson then consults with his engineering crew, and all bar one of them agree to join the mutiny. the sole dissenting engineer, parsons, accuses them of treason and threatens to report them to commander jansen, which results in the other engineers quickly turning on and killing parsons.shortly thereafter, a maintenance engineer named codell discovers evidence that kalgan caused the explosion in the docking bay, and after informing a bridge officer, lt. lamont of this, begins making his journey to the bridge to inform jansen. kalgan intercepts him on the way however, and offers him a choice -

in particular, many officers fall to their deaths over the various railings dotted throughout the ship. eventually ryder sets off an explosion that traps most of the mutineers in that section of the southern sun, but both kalgan and macphearson escape. macphearson isn't able to get very far and resorts to hiding in a gas expulsion sump. ryder (implied to be under the influence of the bellerians) fills the sump with methane gas which he then ignites, causing a fire which burns macphearson to death.with kalgan the only mutineer still at large, ryder and lea pursue him into the ship's bowels in an electric kart. lea gets knocked out of ryder's kart, which she then accidentally disables by shooting it in an effort to take out kalgan, who in turn rams lea with his own kart, causing her a slight injury. after getting his kart working again, ryder aims it at kalgan's kart and drives toward it at full speed, diving out of it at the last second. kalgan is unable to dodge it, and is apparently consumed in a massive explosion.the mutiny seemingly thwarted, ryder and lea apparently make preparations to get married. later however, it turns out that kalgan survived the explosion, ending the film on a cliffhanger.""",cult
