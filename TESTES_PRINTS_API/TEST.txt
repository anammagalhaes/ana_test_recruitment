The movie picks up with Mollie (Kristie Alley) and James (John Travolta) having sex and Mikey (voice of Bruce Willis) getting scared. Mollie and James tell Mikey that he's got to be potty trained. Mollie discovers she's pregnant again and James is working diligently. Mikey learns that with his little sister, Julie, on the way, he has to be a responsible big brother. When Julie is about to be born, her umbilical cord gets caught around her neck, putting her in distress. She is born through a C-section and is taken to the nursery area for observation. When Julie and Mikey meet, she takes an immediate dislike to Mikey. Throughout the film, Mikey becomes jealous of Julie, and their parents' fights about Stuart staying there lead to Mollie kicking out James. Mikey is upset about this and tears up one of Julie's stuffed animals.
